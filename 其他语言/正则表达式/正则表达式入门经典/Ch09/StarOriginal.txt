Star Training Company

Starting from May 1st  Star Training Company is offering a startling special offer to our regular customers - a 20% discount when 4 or more staff attend a single Star Training Company course.

In addition, each quarter our star customer will receive a voucher for a free holiday away from the pressures of the office. Staring at a computer screen all day might be replaced by starfish and swimming in the Seychelles.

Once this offer has started and you hear about other Star Training customers enjoying their free  holiday you might feel left out. Don’t be left on the outside staring in. Start right now building your points to allow you to start out on your very own Star Training holiday.
