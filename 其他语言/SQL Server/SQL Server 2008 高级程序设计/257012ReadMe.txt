This file contains the code and source files used in the book Beginning SQL Server 2008 Programming.

Files here fall into a few categories:

Code shown in the book (found in the "Final Code" subfolder)
Scripts required to create base objects used in examples
Data used in import examples

The book also assumes you have installed the primary AdventureWorks2008 sample 
database (in particular, the OLTP sample). Which can be found at
http://www.wrox.com/go/SQLServer2008RTMDataSets

For x86 users (those running 32bit Windows), you'll need the one labeled:
SQL2008.AdventureWorks_OLTP_DB_v2008.x86.msi 

For x64 users (those running 64bit Windows):
SQL2008.AdventureWorks_OLTP_DB_v2008.x64.msi
