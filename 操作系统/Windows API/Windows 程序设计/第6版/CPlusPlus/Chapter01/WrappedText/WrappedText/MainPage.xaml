            For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out
            my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to
            say "I'm going to sleep." And half an hour later the thought that it was
            time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book
            which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I
            had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just
            been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own,
            until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book:
            a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Fran√ßois I and Charles V. This
            impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not
            disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them
            from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then
            it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former
            existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would
            separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form
            part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I
            would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and
            restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to
            which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark
            indeed.
