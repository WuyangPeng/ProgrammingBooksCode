Sometimes, when I had put out                        my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to                        say "I'm going to sleep." And half an hour later the thought that it was                        time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book                        which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I                        had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just                        been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own,                        until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book:                    </TextBlock>                </local:SplitContainer.Child2>            </local:SplitContainer>        </local:SplitContainer.Child1>        <local:SplitContainer.Child2>            <Ellipse Fill="Blue" />        </local:SplitContainer.Child2>    </local:SplitContainer></Page>
