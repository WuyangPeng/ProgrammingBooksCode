Programming Windows, 6th edition
--------------------------------

These directories contain sample code from "Programming Windows" 6th edition, published by Microsoft Press in January 2013. The programs were developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows 8.

When you load these solutions into Visual Studio, you might get a Security Warning that the project comes from a location that cannot be fully trusted and  might be a security risk. You can ignore this warning.

The code examples in "Programming Windows" 6th edition are in C# (except for some examples in Chapter 15), but I have also translated the sample programs to C++. I have tried to make the C++ programs structurally similar to their C# counterparts. In most cases, the XAML files are identical. Two of the programs (WordFreq in Chapter 7 and YellowPad in Chapter 19) have not yet been converted to C++ 

When these programs are deployed on a Windows 8 machine, the tiles contain a text label that identifies the chapter number and language of the program.
