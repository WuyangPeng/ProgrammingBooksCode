Chapter Order Sample Listing

This table lists sample programs according to what chapter
they are found in. Most sample programs are character-based
console programs. Those programs that are graphically-based
are marked in the table below as GUI. The notes also mention
those samples that are C++, MFC or only work under Windows
NT.

The table in in the next section is in alphabetical order
and gives short descriptions of the various sample programs.
