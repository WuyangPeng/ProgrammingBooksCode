<P>This page will demonstrate how you can access a JET database
using ODBC by making requests one at a time using another process.
</P>

<P>To use this demo, you must have correctly installed IS2ODBC.DLL
and DBSERVER.EXE as described in 00README.DOC.
</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http:/scripts/Is2odbc.dll">Default Query</A> sends
a request to the server to call the default procedure in IS2ODBC.DLL.
This call has no parameters.
</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http:/scripts/Is2odbc.dll?Sort=Title">
Sort by Title Query</A> includes a parameter that will be
included in the SORT section of the SQL query.
</P>

<P>Finally, <A HREF="http://localhost/scripts/Is2odbc.dll?Filter=Category='Networking'">
Filter by Category</A> selects only a subset of the available
records, filtered by the category of the book.
