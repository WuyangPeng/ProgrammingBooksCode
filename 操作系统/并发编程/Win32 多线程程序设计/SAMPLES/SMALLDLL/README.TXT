Building and Using the SMALLDLL sample code
from Multithreading Applications in Win32


To use the samples in this directory, you must first build the DLL
contained in SmallDLL.mak.  Depending on whether you build Release or
Debug, SMALLDLL.DLL will be left in the Release or Debug directories,
respectively.

After building the DLL, there are three driver programs that each call
the DLL in a different way.  Build and run these one at a time.  If you
choose Execute from the Build menu instead of Debug/Go, then the window
will pause and wait for a key to be pressed before disappearing.
