On this CD-ROM you will find the sample programs that
accompany the book Multithreading Applications in Win32. See
Samples\ReadMe.txt for descriptions of the various sample
programs.

If you have any comments, questions or bug reports on these

Here is a short description of what you see in the root
directory:


README.DOC   Microsoft Word 7.0 version of this file.
             
README.TXT   This file.
             
SETUP.EXE    Setup program to install the CD to your hard
             drive. The filenames for the sample code will
             be in mixed upper and lower case after
             installation, making them somewhat easier to
             read.
             
SAMPLES      Contains the source for the sample programs
             in the book.
             
REDIST       Contains the installation for ODBC, required
             to run the IS2ODBC ISAPI sample.
             
BIN          Prebuilt executables for most sample
             programs. These files were built with Visual
             C++ 4.2b. This directory also contains the
             MFC and Visual Basic run-time DLL's.
             

The AUTORUN feature was purposely left off of the CD to make
it more useful when you just need to put the CD in to look
something up.
