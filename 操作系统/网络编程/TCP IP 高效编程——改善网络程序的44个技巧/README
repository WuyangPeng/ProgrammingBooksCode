This is the source code for the skeletons, library routines, and example
programs from _Effective TCP/IP Programming_.  I have compiled and tested
this on FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux, and Windows 98.  If you compile it for
a different system and have to make any non-trivial changes, I would
like to know so that I can include them with the distribution.

In order to compile the code, first change into the subdirectory that
most closely describes your system (bsd, solaris, linux, win), and run
make.  For UNIX systems, this can be either the system make or gmake.
For windows, use nmake.  This will perform whatever initializations are
appropriate for your system.  Next, change back up to the parent (source)
directory and run make again.  That will build build the libraries and
test programs.

Most systems will generate a few trivial warnings for the compilations
of the example programs.  You can ignore these.  The library code compiles
without diagnostics on all the systems that I have tested.

The TCP/IP stack that comes with Win98 does *not* run icmp correctly.
