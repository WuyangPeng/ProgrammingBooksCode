Multiplayer Book
================


Welcome to the code repository for Multiplayer Game Programming: Architecting Networked Games.
Here you will find all the code samples to accompany the code from the book.

Supported Platforms
------------
The code has been tested and runs on Windows with Visual Studio 2013, and on Mac OS X with Xcode 7. Other platforms (including Linux) are currently not supported.

Installation
------------

To install, clone the repository to your local computer.

For the examples in Chapter 13, you'll need Node.js installed from https://nodejs.org
and you'll need to use a terminal or console window to switch to each of the subprojects in the Chapter 13 folder and type

```
npm install
```

That will grab all the necessary node modules and you'll be ready to go!
