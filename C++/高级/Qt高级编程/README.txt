All the book's examples are designed to be educational, and many are
also designed to be useful. I hope that you find them helpful, and are
perhaps able to use some of them as starting points for your own
projects.

Most of the icons and sounds are from KDE (The `K' Desktop Environment),
and come under KDE's LGPL license. (Visit http:///www.kde.org for more
information.)

The entire set of examples can be built in one go by running qmake and
then make (or nmake) in their top level directory---the directory that
contains examples.pro.

STOP PRESS:
[1] The TiledListView::calculateRectsIfNecessary() function does not
    play nicely with SQL-based models whose underlying database doesn't
    report its query size. I've now incorporated an alternative
    implementation (which can be switched on by uncommenting the DEFINE
    line in the .pro file) that solves this problem and which is almost
    the same as Johann's suggested solution.
[2] I have now added an alternative implementation of the
    BoxItem::mouseMoveEvent() handler for Page Designer. By default the
    original implementation is used for pagedesigner1 and the
    alternative one for pagedesigner2.

COMPILER NOTE:
If you get compiler errors regarding std::cos() or std::sin() with a
Microsoft compiler add:
    DEFINES += MSVC_COMPILER
to the affected .pro files (i.e., folderview/folderview.pro,
petridish1/petridish1.pro, and petridish2/petridish2.pro).
If you have a better workaround please let me know.
