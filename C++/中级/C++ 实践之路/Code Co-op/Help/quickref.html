	<font size=5>T</font>he main window of Code Co-op contains <b>tabs</b> corresponding to different working areas:



	<br>&nbsp;<a href="#filea"><b>Files</b></a>,
	<br>&nbsp;<a href="#checkina"><b>Check-in</b></a>,
	<br>&nbsp;<a href="#mailbox"><b>Mailbox</b></a>,

	<br>&nbsp;<a href="#projecta"><b>Projects</b></a> 

	<br>(Click on the tab in the picture to jump to its description.)

	<p>Directly below the tabs you see the <b>toolbar</b>. Its contents
	is context-sensitive. Different buttons are visible in different areas. Some buttons are enabled only when there is a selection in the main window. All commands in the
	toolbar are also available from the menus.

	<p>You will probably use the file area most - let's see what you can do in it.

	<p><b>Toolbar buttons</b> in the file area correspond to the following commands, from left to right,
		<ul>
		<li><a href="function.html#out">Check out</a> selected files.
		<li>Check out all files in the current folder.
		<li><a href="function.html#uncheck">Un-CheckOut</a> (restore selected files to their pre-check-out state).
		<li>Create a brand <a href="function.html#new">new file</a> in the project.
		<li><a href="function.html#add">Add</a> selected files and folders to the project.

	<p>	Some buttons are enabled only when you make a selection.
	<p>In the File area, you can view files and folders that are in the project tree (not necessarily added to the project). This area corresponds to the file-system view of the project tree. Remember, files in the project can be also accessed directly from other applications, e.g., your editor or development environment.

	<hr>
	This is where all the checked-out, deleted and new files go before being checked-in. Double clicking on a file in this area shows the differences between the current state of the file and the state from before the check-out. You can see what changes you've made so far.
	<p><img src="../images/checkin.gif" border="1" alt="Check-in area" width="358" height="116">
	<br>The first button, &quot;check-in all&quot;, is the most used one. In some situations, when you want to do a partial check-in, you can use the second, &quot;check-in selected&quot;, button. Using the third button you can Un-CheckOut a file and undo all the edits you've made since the check-out.

	<hr>
	 The Mailbox area is where you can see all the synch scripts--incoming and outgoing. This is where you do the synchronization by unpacking scripts. Scripts that are ready to be unpacked have distinct icons. This area corresponds to the <a href="function.html#email">OutBox and InBox</a> folders in the file system.
	<p><img src="../images/mailbox.gif" width="392" height="102" border="1" alt="Mailbox">
	<p>The first button is used to unpack the message(s) marked as "Next" and perform the synch. If you hold the mouse cursor over the depressed area in the toolbar, you'll see the synch comment in full, as a tooltip (in case it doesn't fit in the depression).

	<hr>
	This is the area where you can examine the results of a synchronization. You can look at the files that were changed by the synch. Double clicking shows the differences between the new version and the old version. This is where you perform your code reviews. Once you are done reviewing the changes, you accept the synch (first button) and continue.

	<p>If you hold the mouse cursor over the depressed area in the toolbar, you'll see the synch comment in full, as a tooltip (in case it doesn't fit in the depression).
	<p>&quot;Accept Synch All&quot; is the most common operation in the synch area--that's the first button. &quot;Accept Synch Selected&quot; follows it. Notice also the check-out buttons. You can do the &quot;pre-emptive check-out&quot; if you don't like some of the proposed changes and make some edits on the spot. The left pane of the Differ serves as an editor (remember to "refresh" the view in the Differ after you've checked out a file).

	This is the repository of all executed scripts in the order in which they were applied to the project. Your scripts, generated during check-ins, are also shown here.
	<p><img src="../images/hist.gif" width="462" height="172" border="1" alt="History area">
	<p>You can type in file names (with wildcards) in the edit field of the combo box to view the history of selected files. An even better method is to go to the Files area, select some files and choose "View History" from the context menu (right button click). This will bring you to the History area and show you all the scripts that modified these files.
	<p>In the History area you also have access to the selection menu that lets you view and restore previous versions of files or the entire project.<br>
