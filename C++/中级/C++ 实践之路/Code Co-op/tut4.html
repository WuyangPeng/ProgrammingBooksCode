<center><h2>Join Project</h2></center>

<p>Once somebody has created a project, other members may join in. After selecting <i>Join</i> from the <i>Project</i> menu, you'll be presented with the following dialog:
<p><img src="../images/join.gif" width="602" height="419" border="0" alt="Join project dialog">
<p>You'll have to specify the directory for the copy of the <b>source tree</b> on your machine. 
<p><b>Project name</b> must be the same as defined by the original creator of the project (the <i>administrator</i>).
<p>You have to specify the <b>email</b> address of an existing <b>member</b> of the project you're joining. It may be the creator of the project or somebody else, who joined later. Your request to join will be sent to this project member.
<p>Finally, provide your own personal data.
<hr>
<p>After you join, a <b>Join Script</b> is created and dispatched. To accomplish that, the Dispatcher will use the email address of the project member you have specified in your join request. If you're on a hub and the member is on another hub, the Dispatcher will use <b>Simple MAPI</b> to talk to your email program (see Code Co-op Help on <b>dispatching</b>) and send the script. If your email programs are configured correctly, you're set. Just wait for the Full Synch script.

<p>If you're on a Satellite, the Dispatcher will copy the script to the forwarding folder. When the Hub receives this script in its Public Inbox (if you're using a diskette, that's where you should copy the script), the Dispatcher will dispatch it to the appropriate project.

<p>Notice: If the satellite user hasn't specified the sharing path to their Public Inbox (either during setup or in Dispatcher/Preferences), the hub's Dispatcher will ask a question about how to forward scripts to the new Satellite project member. In this dialog:
<ul>
<li>If you're on the network, specify the Satellite's shared Public Inbox.
<li>If you're using a diskette, specify a diskette path, e.g., <var>a:\</var>.
</ul>
<hr>

<p>When the Dispatcher has a script that hasn't been taken care of, its icon changes color and shape:

<p>You can double-click on the Dispatcher's icon to find out which projects have incoming or outgoing scripts. You deal with <b>incoming scripts</b> by firing off Code Co-op, visiting the projects in question and unpacking the scripts. Outgoing scripts should be visible only when you have <i>manual</i> email settings in the Dispatcher. By selecting <i>Send Mail</i> from the Dispatcher's context menu, you'll make them go away. Occasionally, outgoing scripts will be temporarily stuck when a network connection is down or a diskette is not available. The Dispatcher will keep retrying broken network connections once in a while. You can also select <i>Dispatch Locally</i> to force network or diskette dispatching.
<hr>
<p>This is what the incoming Join Request script looks like in the administrator's Code Co-op:
<p><img src="../images/joinreq.gif" width="388" height="208" border="0" alt="Join request script">
<p>The administrator should now unpack this script by clicking on the first button from the left (the upside-down envelope spilling its contents). This will result in the creation of the <b>Full-Synch</b> script, which will be propagated by the Dispatcher back to the joinee.
<p>Notice: If the join request was sent to a member who is <i>not</i> the administrator, their Code Co-op will forward it to the administrator.
