A <b>version control system</b> (VCS) is an indespensable tool for every serious developer. Even if you're working alone, a VCS will keep track of your progress and let you undo unwanted changes. You wouldn't want to use an editor without an undo--a VCS offers you an extension of this feature by letting you restore arbitrarily old versions of files. 
<p>Of course, if you are <b>collaborating</b> with other developers, you already know that you can't live without a version control system. The only thing that might be stopping you from purchasing one is  high price and notorious user-unfriendliness of most such systems. This situation is about to  change!
<p><b>Code Co-op</b> is a full-featured reliable yet affordable version control system for individual developers and small teams (up to 20 people) of developers. If you can afford the basic tools of your trade--a compiler for <b>programmers</b> or an HTML editor for <b>web developers</b>--you can surely afford Code Co-op. And once you start using it, you won't want to work without it!

<center><h2>Code Co-op Tutorial</h2></center>
<p>This is a very simple introductory tutorial that will lead you through the process of configuring your Code Co-op. It will also show hot wo create a new project and how to join an existing project. Even (or maybe especially) if you have previous experience with version control systems, you should follow this tutorial. Code Co-op introduces several new concepts into the  area of version control systems. Once you familiarize yourself with these concepts, you'll find them indispensable in your future work.
<p>If this is a fresh install of Code Co-op, you should be seeing right now a configuration dialog displayed by the <b>Dispatcher</b> component of Code Co-op.

<p>To answer this first question, about the <b>transport</b>, you have to decide on how the various computers involved in the project will communicate with each other. 
<ul>
<li>If all computers are on the same local area network (LAN), use the <i>LAN-only</i> option. 
<li>If none has access to a LAN, use the <i>e-mail-only</i> option. 
<li>If some computers are on a LAN, but others are not, use the <i>LAN and e-mail</i> option.
<li>Finally, if there is only one computer, use the <i>standalone</i> option.
</ul>
