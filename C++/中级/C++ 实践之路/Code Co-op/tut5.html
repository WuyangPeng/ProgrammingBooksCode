<p>In response to your Join Request, you will receive the <b>Full Synch</b> script from the administrator. Click on the button with upside-down envelope to unpack it.

<p>As a result, a complete copy of the project will be created on your machine, in the directory that you specified in your Join dialog. You'll be able to see project files in Code Co-op, check them out, edit and check them back in (see Code Co-op's Help).

<p>To work with project files, you can go directly to the project directory, outside of Code Co-op, and use your favorite tools--the editor, the compiler, etc. Make sure that, before you modify any file, you check it out using Code Co-op (the files are made read-only when they are not checked out, to prevent accidental changes).
