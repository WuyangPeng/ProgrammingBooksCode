- This readme file

- Source code for:
  o the examples in the first part of the book
  o some of the digressions, like value semantics or operator new
    overloading
  The rest of the source code is in the form of Code Co-op scripts,
  as explained in the introduction to the book.

- The Installation program that will install Code Co-op on your 
  computer. Code Co-op is a version control system that can be used
  to follow the development of a software project step-by-step.

- Software projects described in the book. Once you have installed
  Code Co-op, you can easily re-create these projects. Each step
  in the development of the project corresponds to a synchronization
  script which you unpack and review using Code Co-op.

- Solutions to the exercises from part one of the book and a few
  from the later parts of the book.

- Complete HTML Code Co-op Help.

- A link to Reliable Software web site where you can find additional

Troubleshooting:
----------------

If, during the installation of Code Co-op on Win95 you get an error, 
"SETUP.EXE file is linked to missing export KERNEL32.DLL:GetDiskFreeSpaceExA,"
it means that you have the oldest edition of Win95. You need to
install at least Win95 Service Pack One in order to proceed. Service packs
containing bug fixes are available through the Microsoft web site.
