you can navigate all contents of the CD-ROM.

If you are running another operating system, you should insert the CD into
your CD-ROM drive, run your web browser of choice, and open the "index.html"
file in the root directory of the CD-ROM, from which
you can navigate all contents of the CD-ROM.

Installing Software

Instructions for installing the software compilers, tools and utilities are
provided on the appropriate pages: "Compilers," "Libraries," and "Tools"
pages, accessed via the "index.html" file in the root directory of the
