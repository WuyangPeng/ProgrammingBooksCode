<h2>std.windows.registry</h2>
<p>D's Registry module (std.windows.registry) provides fuller support for the variety of registry types&#151;including REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_DWORD (Little or Big endian), REG_QWORD, REG_BINARY&#151;than does the .NET Microsoft.Win32 namespace, which supports only the writing of REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_BINARY, and REG_DWORD. This means that, unlike the case with .NET, there is no need to step outside of the Registry module in order to achieve all the things one needs to do with the Win32 registry. Hence, other higher-level modules, such as the COM module, can be built on it in a clean and orthogonal manner, reflecting the D philosophy of "as in(ter)dependent as necessary, but no more."</p>
