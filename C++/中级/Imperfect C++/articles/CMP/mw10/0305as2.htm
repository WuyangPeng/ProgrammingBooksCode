<h1>System Time</h1>
<p>The documentation for <b>GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()</b> states that it is equivalent to consecutive calls to <b>GetSystemTime()</b> and <b>SystemTimeToFileTime()</b>, as in: </p>

<pre>
  void GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(LPFILETIME lpft)
  {
      SYSTEMTIME  st;

      GetSystemTime(&amp;st);
      SystemTimeToFileTime(&amp;st, lpft);
  }
</pre>

<p>While this is true from a functional perspective, it is certainly not the case that it is actually implemented in this way on all operating systems, as can be seen in <A HREF="0305at6.htm" target="_BLANK">Table 6</A>.</p>

<p>On Windows 98, the call costs are roughly equivalent. However, on all the NT-family operating systems, the cost of gleaning time in the form of an intermediate SYSTEMTIME is around 400 times that of <b>GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()</b>.</p>
