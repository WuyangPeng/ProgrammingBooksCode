Source files from Chapter 8

All files in this directory were
linted, compiled, and tested under:
    Borland C++ 4.0 (large memory model)
    Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 (small memory model)
    Watcom C 10.0 (extended DOS)
    UnixWare 2.0 (SVR4)

        calcmain.c (listing 8-1)
        longmath.c (listing 8-2 through 8-19)
        longmath.h (listing 8-20)
        sqrtmain.c (listing 8-21)
        amrtmain.c (listing 8-22)

    When compiling a driver and the library of longmath
    functions that appear in longmath.c, it is *important*
    to make sure that MAX_SIZE is #defined for the same
    number of digits of precision in both the driver and
    the library. To aid in this, makefiles for the three
    drivers are included. The makefiles are written for
    Borland C compilers using large memory models. However,
    they are heavily commented and easily ported to other
    compilers. The files are:

        calcmain.mak
        sqrtmain.mak
        amrtmain.mak

The purchased copy of this diskette (see back page of book
for ordering details) contains sample driver scripts to
test and exercise the calculator and demonstrate syntax
of the scripting.
