    The book versions of rle1.c and unrle1.c programs *must* be
    compiled with the default of unsigned chars. If this is not done,
    some compilers (especially under UNIX) will not uncompress
    properly if the sentinel is > 0x80 (which it is by default).
    To avoid the problem of it being incorrectly compiled,
    the version on the disk is slightly different from the
    book version: all char declarations/definitions have been
    changed to unsigned char. No other changes were performed.
    The result is that the disk versions of these programs can
    be compiled on any platform and work correctly.


The following code mentioned but not printed in the book is available
only on the purchased diskette (see last page of the book for
ordering information:

    mscomp.c

    mscomp.c is a compression program that produces
    files in the same format as Microsoft's compress.exe
    program. These files can be uncompressed with mslzunc.c.
    This program uses sliding-window compression. It compresses
    better than the Microsoft version but runs more slowly
    Use it only for compressing the final version of data.
    However, it is also the most effective compression
    technique that is not patented (LZW is faster and more
    effective, but patented as explained in the book).
