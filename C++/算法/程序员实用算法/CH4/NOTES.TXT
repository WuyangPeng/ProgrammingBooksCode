Source files from Chapter 4

All files in this directory were
linted, compiled, and tested under:
    Borland C++ 4.0 (large memory model)
    Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 (small memory model)
    Watcom C/C++ 10.0 (extended DOS)
    UnixWare 2.0 (SVR4)

        brute1.c   (listing 4-1)
        brute2.c   (listing 4-2)
        boyermor.c (listing 4-3)
        msrch.c    (listing 4-4)
        minigrep.c (listing 4-5)
        approx.c   (listing 4-6)
        soundex.c  (listing 4-7)
        metaphon.c (listing 4-8)

    Due to the varied nature of the searches, the command
    line syntax and the program functions vary slightly.

    brute1.c, brute2.c, and boyermor.c only search through
    the first 10,000 characters in the file. As explained,
    this was done to show the search engine's innards without
    burying them in the file-management code that any programmer
    could write.

    approx.c expects two parameters: the search string and the
    text to search. Note that text is not a file but a string
    specified on the command line.

    This implementation of grep (called minigrep) accepts a
    wildcard pattern string and searches through a file. You can use
    the UNIX wildcard syntax, except that the pattern string cannot
    begin with an * or a ?

    Finally, metaphon.c had a small bug in the initializations
    processing as listed in the book. The correction and the comments
    for it appear in Listing 4-8.
