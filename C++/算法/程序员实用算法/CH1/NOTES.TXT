Source files from Chapter 1

All files in this directory were
linted, compiled, and tested under:
    Borland C++ 4.0 (large memory model)
    Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 (small memory model)

        bufsize.c  (listing 1-1)

This program reports the number of clock ticks required
to copy a designated file using a variety of optionally
specified input and output buffers. Only MS-DOS versions
are provided, because there is no portable way under UNIX
to measure clock ticks or fractions of a second. Under
UNIX, you could have it measure elapsed seconds--using time()--
and run the program on very large files to see the impact
of buffer sizes. Several timings would have to be run in
such cases, because UNIX will memory map files. The point
of this program is to quantify the benefits of buffering
on I/O. So under UNIX, you will initially be measuring the
disk access gains, then the far smaller memory access gains.
Be aware of what you're measuring under UNIX.
