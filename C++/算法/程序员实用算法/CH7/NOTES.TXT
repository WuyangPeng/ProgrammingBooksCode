Source files from Chapter 7

All files in this directory were
linted, compiled, and tested under:
    Borland C++ 4.0 (large memory model)
    Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 (small memory model)
    Watcom C 10.0 (extended DOS)
    UnixWare 2.0 (SVR4)

        lilcal.c   (listing 7-1)
        datelib.h  (listing 7-2)
        datelib.c  (contains all the date and time
                    presented in chapter 7)

    datelib.c comes with a driver to exercise the various functions.
    It reads in a script such as that contained by datetest.scr.
    This script was used primarily for debugging purposes; however
    it does show the output of a variety of date and time functions.

    lilcal.c calls the functions in datelib.c. To compile datelib.c
    to be a true library, you must make sure to comment out DRIVER.
    When DRIVER is commented out, no main() is included and the
    resulting file can be used as a library or linkable module.
