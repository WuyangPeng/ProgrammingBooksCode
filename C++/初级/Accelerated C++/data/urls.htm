<cite>
This is a first-rate introductory book that takes a practical approach
to solving problems using C++.  It covers a much wider scope of C++
progamming than other introductory books I've seen, and in a
surprisingly compact format.

The authors present a clear, cogent introduction to C++ programming in
a way that gets the student writing nontrivial programs immediately.

Anyone reading just this one book and working through the examples and
exercises will have the same skills as many professional programmers.

<P>
Why is <strong>Accelerated C++</strong> so effective?  Because it

<UL>
<LI>
Starts with the most useful concepts rather than the most primitive
ones:
<br><em>You can begin writing programs immediately.</em>
<LI>
Describes real problems and solutions, not just language features:
<br><em>You see not only what each feature is, but also how to use it.</em>
<LI>
Covers the language and standard library together:
<br><em>You can use the library right from the start.</em>
</UL>
<P>
The authors proved this approach in their professional-education
course at Stanford University, where students learned how to write
substantial programs on their first day in the classroom.
