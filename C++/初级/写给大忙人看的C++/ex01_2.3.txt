It doesn't matter how many iterations you run, because a
mathematcian is not convinced by a finite number of cases, no matter
how large. Instead, mathematicians require deductive proof, which
settles the matter logically for all possible cases.

Therefore, the program in this exercise is likely to be convincing
to everyone except a theoretical mathematician!
