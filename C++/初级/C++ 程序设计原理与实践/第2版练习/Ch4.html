<li><b>Exercise 3</b>:
Read a sequence of doubles into a vector. Think of each value as the distance between two cities along a given route. Compute and print the total distance (the sum of all distances). Find and print the smallest and greatest distance between two neighboring cities. Find and print the mean distance between two neighboring cities.

<li><b>Exercise 5</b>:
Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator.
Your calculator should be able to handle the five basic math operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide on two input values.
Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: two <b>double</b> values and a character to represent an operation.
If the entry arguments are <b>35.6</b>, <b>24.1</b>, and <b>+</b>; the program output should be <b>"The sum of 35.6 and 24.1 is 59.7."</b>
In chapter 6, we look at a much more sophisticated simple calculator.

<li><b>Exercise 6</b>:
Make a <b>vector</b> holding the ten <b>string</b> values <b>"zero"</b>, <b>"one"</b>, .. <b>"nine"</b>.
Use that in a program that converts a digit to its corresponding spelled out value; e.g., the input <b>7</b> gives the output <b>seven</b>.
Have the same program, using the same input loop, convert spelled out numbers into their digit form; e.g., the input <b>seven</b> gives the output <b>7</b>.
<p>
See Exercise 7.


<li><b>Exercise 7</b>:
Modify the ``mini calculator'' from exercise 5 to accept (just) single-digit numbers written as either digits or spelled out.

<li><b>Exercise 10</b>:
Write a program that plays the game "Rock, paper, scissors." If you are not familiar with the game do some research (e.g. on the web using Google).
Research is a common task for programmers. Use a switch statement to solve this exercise. Also, the machine should give random answers
(i.e., select the next Rock, paper, or scissors randomly). Real randomness is too hard to provide just now, so just build a vector with a sequence of values
to be used as "the next value." If you build the vector into the program, it will always play the same game, so maybe you should let the user enter some values).
Try variations to make it less easy for the user to guess which move the machine will do next.

<li><b>Exercise 11</b>:
Compute the prime numbers between 1 and 100. See the book for details.
