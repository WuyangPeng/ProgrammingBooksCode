	This exercise is simply 4-19 done with a vector of pairs rather than a pair of vectors.

	I wrote this by a simple cut and paste of the solution to 4-19 and it worked (not too
	surprisingly) first time. It is often a great time saver to have a program that already
	has been written and tested on whichto build a new on.

	One the onther hand: If there were bugs in 4-19, they are also here.

	Do you prefer this solution or the one from 4-19? If you have a preference, why?
