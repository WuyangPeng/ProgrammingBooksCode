/*
	I think this code is rather tedious. That is, it repeats similar code three times with different
	variable names. How do we know that it is correct?

	Is there a *simple* way of doing less work? (yes) Does doing less work make this code easier to understand?
	
	What would e have to do to do this exercise for four variables? for five?
	How many if-statements would you need for four variables? for five variables?
	Chapter 4 will give us the key tool for better solutions: vectors.
