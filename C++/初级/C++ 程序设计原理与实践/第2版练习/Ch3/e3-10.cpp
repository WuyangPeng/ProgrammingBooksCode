/*
	While testing, I found it tedious to keep re-starting the program to enter a new set of values,
	so I added the while-loop. I know that loops won't be explained in detail until Chapter 4, but
	we did show a while loop in Chapter 3 and anyway, you *know* about doing things repeatedly from
	everyday life so "keep doing this until you run out of inputs" is well known.

	It is always a good idea to be sure that a divisor isn't zero.
