HOW TO SET UP THE SOURCE CODE EXAMPLE PROJECT

The source code download has been organized into a Maven-managed
project in order to avoid you unnecessarily downloading a bunch of
large .jar files over a slow network connection. This also allows
you to get started quickly whether you use Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
as your weapon of choice because Maven can generate the necessary
project files for you. Oh, and you need Java 5 on your machine to
be able to compile and run the examples.

Without further ado, let's get started.

1. Install Java 5 from
   http://java.sun.com

2. Install Maven (version 2.0.7 or newer) from 
   http://maven.apache.org

3. Download the book source code from
   http://www.tddinaction.com/sourcecode.zip

4. Unzip the source code archive in your workspace directory

5. Open a console window to the extracted directory and run
   mvn eclipse:eclipse (if you use Eclipse, or)
   mvn idea:idea (if you use IntelliJ IDEA)

6. Run a clean build to make sure everything is working fine
   mvn clean test

And you're done!
