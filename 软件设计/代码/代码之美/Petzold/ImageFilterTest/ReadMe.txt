This program, called ImageFilterTest, was written for the book "Beautiful Code"
(O'Reilly, 2007) and is described in my chapter in that book.

The program is written in C# using the Windows Forms class library of the
Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.  It can be compiled using Visual Studio 2005.

The ImageIO.cs, ImageOpen.cs, ImagePrint.cs, and ImageClip.cs files are
from my book "Programming Windows with C#" (Microsoft Press, 2001).

The ImageFilterTest.cs file is the entry point to the program and defines 
several menu items for testing digital filters.  

The ImageFilter.cs file contains the actual implementation of the digital
filters.
