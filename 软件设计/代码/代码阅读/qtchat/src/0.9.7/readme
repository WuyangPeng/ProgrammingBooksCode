- Adding menu entries

Extending the client to include your own functionality via the main menu
bar is simple.  It does, however, require recompilation of the client at
the present time.  The following files are affected at a minimum:
	./gui/menubar.h
	./gui/menubar.cc
	./gui/mainwidget.cc

Here's the steps:

1. Edit ./gui/menubar.h to include a MenuItem type label for your new
   menu entry.  The naming convention should be obvious from the file:
	  MENU_<menubar label>_<submenu label>_<subsubmenu label>_ ...
   Place the entry in close proximity to its relative neighbors.
2. Edit ./gui/menubar.cc to add the code to the MenuBar constructor to
   add your new item to the menubar in the correct place.  This should
	also be fairly simple to discern from the other entries in the file.
3. Edit ./gui/mainwidget.cc to add a handler for the menu item in
   handleMenuEvent() method of class MainWindow.  Also simple.
