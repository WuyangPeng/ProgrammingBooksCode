<H3>Client-only Web Shop</H3>
<P>
Using Hypersonic SQL, it is possible to create a Web Shop that resides
on the client only. The web shop contains just simple static files. 
On the server side, just a simple plain web server is required. No CGI, 
no ASP, JSP, Servlets,... are required. This means it is possible to 
create a sophisticated Web Shop using just simple files and host it on 
a free site, with absolutely no cost.
<P>
Anyway, modern 3 tier architecture is used in this Web Shop; the difference
is that the User Interface, the Business Logic and the Database are all
running on the client side (inside the browser). This is how it works:
<P>

<P>
Inside the browser runs a Applet with the Business Logic tier (a simple Java
Class) and the Database tier (the applet version of the Hypersonic SQL database).
The applet is only about 45 KB. The user interface is inside the HTML page
(or multiple pages, if the Applet runs in an own frame), and 'talks' to the
Applet using JavaScript. After the user filled his shopping cart, he sends the 
order using an e-mail (or using a CGI that sends the mail as in the example Web Shop).
<P>
An example shop using this technology is available here:

<P>
Sorry, this site is currently only available in German. The shop resides
in Switzerland, and the owner will not send items abroad.

<H3>Query Tool Demo</H3>
<P>
This demo uses the standalone and in-memory mode. This means after the 
program is exited, all data is lost. There is also a persistent mode where
the data is stored on disk and a client/server version.
