<H2>Operating modes</H2>
<P>
Hypersonic SQL has three operating modes:
<UL>
<LI>In-Memory (non-persistent, using the memory only)
<LI>Standalone (with logging to disk, and maybe data written to disk)
<LI>Client/Server (multiple computers/applications can access the same database)
</UL>
<P>
<H3>In-Memory</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/modeInMemory.gif" ALT="In-Memory">
<P>
In the in-memory mode, all data (indexes and data records) are kept in 
the main memory. That means the size of the database is limited by the 
amount of available memory. Each (general) record will need about 500 
bytes of memory. The reasons why Hypersonic SQL does support this mode are:
<UL>
<LI>It is much faster
<LI>Memory is cheap
<LI>It can be used in applets
</UL>
The mode is used by the demo applet. When the browser is closed, 
all data is lost.
<P>
The JDBC URL (see also below) for the In-Memory mode is: 
<FONT SIZE=3>
<PRE>jdbc:hsqldb:.</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
<H3>Standalone</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/modeStandalone.gif" ALT="Standalone">
<P>
In the standalone mode, the changes to the database (currently the uncompressed 
SQL statements) are written to disk. Tables can be created so that
the records are stored on disk and only some records are cached in memory.
This is done by creating tables using 'CREATE CACHED TABLE' instead
of 'CREATE TABLE'. This allows to use big tables where the records 
need too much space to fit into memory. Indexes of cached tables are also 
saved to disk, so the size of the database is not limited by the main
memory. Access to cached tables is slower than access to tables that are in memory.
<P>
Before closing the database an SQL script describing the current state of the 
database is written to disk. The log file is then deleted. When starting Hypersonic 
SQL the database is loaded from disk (the SQL script is executed). If the 
database crashes (for example using Ctrl+C or power loss) no information is 
lost. This is because the next time it is started, it recovers automatically 
to the last state using the log file.
<P>
In this mode, only one application can access a database at a time. 
To access the same database at the same time from multiple JVM or 
computers the Client/Server version must be used.
<P>
The JDBC URL for the Standalone mode is: 
<FONT SIZE=3>
<PRE>jdbc:hsqldb:test</PRE>
</FONT>
where test is the database file name. Another example (Windows) is:
<FONT SIZE=3>
<PRE>jdbc:hsqldb:c:\db\test</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
<H3>Client / Server</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/modeClientServer.gif" ALT="Client / Server">
<P>
The database is not running in the same Virtual Machine as the
application, but as a server in an own process or on a separate computer.
This operating mode is similar to 'big' databases; except that Hypersonic 
SQL supports also the standardized HTTP protocol for communication between 
client and server. Like this it is possible to connect via Internet or 
Intranet to the database. It is not necessary that the client computers 
have access to the file system of the server. Because the HTTP protocol is 
used, it is also possible to connect to the database through firewalls and 
proxy servers.
<P>
There are three Client / Server version included in the download: 
The Server, the WebServer and the Servlet.
<P>
<H4>Server</H4>
<P>
This version communicates with the client over TCP/IP and uses a proprietary
protocol. There is a connection for each client. This is very fast, but 
normally does not work over Internet (through to proxy servers and firewalls).
<P>
The JDBC URL is: 
<FONT SIZE=3>
<PRE>jdbc:hsqldb:hsqldb://hsqldbsrv</PRE>
</FONT> where 'hsqldbsrv' is the computer name. To run more than one server on 
one computer, different port numbers must be used: <FONT SIZE=3> 
<PRE>jdbc:hsqldb:hsqldb://hsqldbsrv:9002</PRE>
</FONT>
The local computer is called 'localhost'.
<P>
<H4>WebServer</H4>
<P>
This is a small and simple web-server that can transfer files and also execute 
queries against the database.
<P>
An example URL is: 
<FONT SIZE=3>
<PRE>jdbc:hsqldb:http://websrv</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
<H4>Servlet</H4>
<P>
The database is run inside a database Servlet. Servlets can be run on almost 
any web-server now. The source code for the servlet is also included.  
It is compatible to the Java Servlet API and tested with the jsdk 2.1.
<P>
The URL for the Servlet mode is the same as for the WebServer mode.
<P>
<H3>Combinations</H3>
<P>
All this modes can be combined in a single application. It is possible
that a application uses for example all four modes at the same time, this
are then four different databases. Here is some example code how this can
be done:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<PRE>
c1=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:.","sa","");
c2=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:test","sa","");
c3=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:http://dbserver","sa","");
c4=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:hsqldb://dbserver","sa","");
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
In this example are three connections opened: c1 for the in-memory
database, c2 opens the local database 'test' and c3 connects
to the computer 'dbserver' using the HTTP protocol. c4 connects
also to dbserver, but using the faster Hypersonic SQL protocol.

<H3>Comparison</H3>
<P>
Each mode has other features and negative and positive sides:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/modeCompare.gif" ALT="Comparisation">
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Transactions possible:<BR>
Because the HTTP protocol is connection-less,
for each query a new database connection is created. 
The user name and password is sent for each query to
the database, and a new connection (and also transaction,
because each transaction is bound to its connection) is
started. A workaround would be to use 'cookies', but
currently this is not implemented.
<LI>Database Performance Factor:<BR>
Because the In-Memory mode does not access the file
system, all queries are about 30% faster. This is because
for the other modes, each INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE is saved
to disk. SELECTs are for all modes (almost) the same.
<LI>Transfer Time per Statement:<BR>
Each statement must be sent to the server over TCP/IP
and the result must be sent back to the client. The
WebServer and the Servlet need much more time because
for each statement a new connection must be created.
Of course all this are only 'about' values.
<LI>Run as Applet: This means works inside a web-browser
by default. If the security for applets is relaxed, also
the other modes can run as applet, but not by default.
