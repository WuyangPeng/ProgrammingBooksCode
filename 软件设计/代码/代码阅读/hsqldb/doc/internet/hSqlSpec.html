</UL>
<P>
<a NAME="SECURITY"></a>
<STRONG>Database security</STRONG>
<P> There is a built-in security system using users, passwords and access rights. 
  There exists by default a 'System Administrator' with the user name 'sa' and 
  the password '' (empty password). This special user can create new users, drop 
  users and grant and revoke access rights for tables to other users. The general 
  users can only change their own password and connect as another user. All this 
  user administration can be done by SQL scripts (GRANT, REVOKE). Access can be 
  granted also to PUBLIC. 
<P>
<a NAME="AUTOINCREMENT"></a>
<STRONG>Identity (autoincrement) column type</STRONG>
<P>
Identity columns can be used to serve as automatic unique row 
identifier for a table. When a new row is added to the table 
and the identity column is not inserted (or a NULL value is inserted), 
then Hypersonic SQL provides a unique, incremental value for 
the column. The identity column is automatically the primary key
of the table. Only one identity column can be created per table. 
In Hypersonic SQL, identity values can be updates and values can 
be inserted in a identity column.
<P>
<a NAME="CODESWITCHER"></a>
<STRONG>Switchable Source Code: CodeSwitcher</STRONG>
<P>
Included is CodeSwitcher, a tool to manage different version
of Java source code. It helps to compile Hypersonic SQL for different
JDKs. This 'CodeSwitcher' is something like a precompiler in C 
and C++, but it works directly on the source code and does not make 
intermediate output and does not create other files. This means 
the code can be switched to be this or the other version, and then used 
(edit, compile, debug,...) without loosing code of other versions. All 
it does is commenting out code that is not used for a version and 'comment 
in' code that is needed. It is possible to use the Code Switcher in batch 
operations where multiple versions of an application are built. CodeSwitcher 
is (of course) a Java application.
<P>
<a NAME="METADATA"></a>
<STRONG>Metadata support</STRONG>
<P>
Hypersonic SQL supports system tables that are build dynamically when a query 
is made to them. This tables provide database metadata. The names 
of the tables are 'SYSTEM_' followed by the same as the according database 
meta data function. For example the function 'getColumns' queries the table 'SYSTEM_COLUMNS'. 
<P>
There are two additional tables:
<UL>
<LI>SYSTEM_CONNECTIONINFO<BR>
This table contains information about the current connection. All users have
access to read this system tables.
</LI>
<LI>SYSTEM_USERS<BR>
Returns a resultset with the user names and the admin flag for each user.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<a NAME="READONLY"></a>
<STRONG>Readonly connection and database support</STRONG>
<P>
Connections can be set to readonly using the command SET READONLY [TRUE|FALSE] 
or using the method Connection.setReadOnly(boolean readonly). Additionally
the whole database can be put in read-only mode by manually adding the line 'readonly=true'
to the .properties file. All connections are then automatically readonly. The database
files will then be opened in readonly mode, and it is thus possible to create a CD 
with this database.

<P>
<a NAME="BIGRESULTS"></a>
<STRONG>Selecting big results / Scanning big tables</STRONG>
<P>
One limitation of Hypersonic SQL is that it does currently not support server 
side cursors. This means the result of a query must always fit in memory, otherwise
an OutOfMemory error occurs. In the rare situation that a huge resultsets must be 
processed, then the following workaround can be used: Limit the ResultSet using 
Statement.setMaxRows(1024), and select multiple 'smaller' blocks. If the table
is for example 'CREATE TABLE Test(Id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR)' then
the first block can be selected using 'SELECT * FROM Test ORDER BY Id' and the next 
block using 'SELECT * FROM Test WHERE Id>(bigest_id) ORDER BY Id' until no more records
are returned. Don't forget to switch of the limit using setMaxRows(0).

<P>
<a NAME="#COMPACT"></a>
<STRONG>Compacting the database</STRONG>
<P>
The database file should grow automatically, empty space (after deleting records) 
should be re-used automatically, and the file should shrink finally if data is deleted.
<P>
In Hypersonic SQL, not all of this is things are currently implemented for the .data
file. In most cases empty space (caused by deleted records) is re-used, because a 
list of 1024 free blocks is kept. But this list is lost when the database is closed.
In one case (DROP TABLE) the space is not reclaimed. This is similar to the 
behaviour of Microsoft Access (MS Access never re-uses the empty space, even in the 
same session).
<P>
To shrink all files to the minimum size, use the SQL command 'SHUTDOWN COMPACT'
when closing the database. It is a good idea to run this command also before 
creating a read-only database.
<P>
<a NAME="#STORED"></a>
<STRONG>Java Stored Procedures / Functions</STRONG>
<P>
Stored procedures are Java functions that are called
directly from the SQL language or using an alias.
Calling Java functions (directly or using the alias) requires 
that the Java class can be reached by the database (server).
User defined stored procedures / functions must be places
where the database server runs. For Hypersonic SQL, stored
procedures and functions are equal. The syntax for calling functions 
and stored procedures (inside a SELECT statement for example) is:
<p>
SELECT Value, "java.lang.Math.sqrt"(Value) AS SQRT FROM Test
<P>
It can be called also without the SELECT, using the command
CALL. This makes more sense for 'Stored Procedures' but works
for functions, too:
<P>
CALL "java.lang.Math.sqrt"(2.0)
<P>
The packacke must be provided, and the name
must be written as one word, and inside " because otherwise
it is converted to uppercase (and not found).
<p>
An alias can be created using the command CREATE ALIAS:
<p>
CREATE ALIAS SQRT FOR "java.lang.Math.sqrt"
<p>
When an alias is defined, then the function can be 
called additionally using this alias:
<p>
CALL SQRT(2.0)
<br>SELECT Value, SQRT(Value) AS SQRT FROM Test
<P>
This are the rules when creating user defined functions / stored 
procedures:
<UL>
<LI>The function must be 'public static'
<LI>Parameters that are not provided by the user are filled with 'null'
by the system. For example SIN() is equal to SIN(NULL). SIN is the alias
for java.lang.Math.sin.
<LI>When a parameter is 'null' and the parameter type in the function
is a basic data type (for example 'int', 'double') then the function is not called
at all and 'null' is returned by the system. In the example above
java.lang.Math.sin(double d) is not called because the parameter d is 'null'.
<LI>When a parameter can be null, don't use the basic data types 
(for example int) use the class instead (for example java.lang.Integer).
  <LI>An example for functions with optional parameters is org.hsqldb.substring(String 
    s,int start,Integer length): the parameters 'length' is optional. If not provided 
    by the user, it is filled with 'null' by the system, and the function is called. 
  <LI>If you need a Connection in your function, just provide a parameters 'Connection'. 
    This parameter will be filled by Hypersonic SQL. Example is the function org.hsqldb.Library.user(Connection 
    conn). The function is called by the user with: CALL USER() 
  <LI>Stored procedures (or 'constants' like PI) with no paramters are called 
with brackets: PI(). PI alone can be a (table- or column-) name.
</UL>
There is also a security mechanism provided: Access to each class
can be granted / revoked to a user:
<P>
GRANT ALL ON "java.lang.Math" TO PUBLIC
<P> By default, all users have access to java.lang.Math and org.hsqldb.Library.
