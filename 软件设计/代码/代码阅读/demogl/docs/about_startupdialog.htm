<h4>The startup dialog.</h4>
DemoGL provides true resolution/bitdepth/screendepth/soundhardware independance for the developer. This way
the developer just programs for one resolution (using floating point coordinates instead of pixel oriented int
coordinates) and bitdepth (32bpp), and the end user can select the settings that fits his/her system best. DemoGL
powered applications by default start with the startup dialog (a developer can provide his own startup dialog, 
see for more information <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">DEMOGL_AppRun</a> in the DemoGL Reference manual
on a discussion about runtypes). The startup dialog provides the user to set all kinds of runtime settings, like 
windowed or full screen execution, window resolution, bitdepth for textures, bitdepth for the framebuffer, soundsystem 
related options like EAX/A3D support, playback quality etc.
The developer can customize this default startup dialog by supplying a bitmap as resource in the application. The bitmap
should have a size of 91x433 pixels (width X height). The resource should have ID symbol 140.
<p>
A typical startup dialog looks like this:

The default settings of the different controls on the startup dialog are retrieved from the registry and if the registry doesn't
contain any settings for the particular application, DemoGL fill use the supplied settings in the 
<a HREF="ref_structures_SStartupDat.htm">SStartupDat</a>
structure, passed
to <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">DEMOGL_AppRun</a> when the application execution was started. When an application
is ran for the first time on a machine, the registry will not contain any settings for the application. When the user selects
the option 'Save settings in registry' on the startup dialog, DemoGL will save all control's settings to the registry key:
HKCU/Software/DemoGL/Application/<i>Application title</i>/AppData. When the application is ran again, DemoGL will read these
settings and will overrule any setting set in the SStartupDat structure passed to DEMOGL_AppRun.
<p>
A developer can block certain settings in the startup dialog. When the developer doesn't want any rescaling of texturedata, 
this feature can be blocked by setting the variable DGL_VF_NEVERRESCALETEXTURES using 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SetVariable.htm">DEMOGL_SetVariable</a>. When the application doesn't use any sound, it's recommended
to block the enable sound option in the startup dialog. This can be done by setting the SStartupDat member <b>m_bSound</b> to false.
<p>
<b>Screensavers</b><br>
When the application is a screensaver, DemoGL will not start with the startup dialog, because a screensaver should start immediately.
Instead, DemoGL will show the startup dialog when the user presses 'Settings' on the screensaver tab in 'display properties' in Windows.
This is default behaviour which can be overruled by providing an own dialog for 'configurating' the screensaver properties. See 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">DEMOGL_AppRun</a> in the DemoGL Reference manual for details.
