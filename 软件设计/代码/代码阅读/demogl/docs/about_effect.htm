<h4>The CEffect class.</h4>
One of the building blocks of DemoGL are the effect classes, stored in C++ classes derived from the base class <i>CEffect</i>.
A normal audiovisual application, build without DemoGL, normally would have several routines to generate the different
audiovisual effects. DemoGL applications are build up differently. A developer should think in schedulable 
audiovisual effectblocks. These effectblocks are then implemented in C++ classes, derived from CEffect, the base class
exported by the DemoGL system. DemoGL itself executes the application, so the application itself is <i>split</i> in
effect classes which are ran by DemoGL when ordered to do so. The example from the <a href="about_whatisdemogl.htm">What is DemoGL</a>
topic is in fact an application that can visualize 3 effects and has a 4rth 'effect' doing maintainance work. Programming
the logic to visualize this in a normal application would probably result in a big for(;;) loop with a switch() statement
when to call which subroutine to visualize the effects. The developer should recognize the blocks in the application
and should understand how the application can be done using DemoGL: put the right blocks in effect classes and the
rest should be cut away since DemoGL will handle the rest. 
<p>
A good way of doing this is to understand what should be done in each frame that should be rendered by the application.
Focussing on the visualisation and audio aspects of each frame is all that should be done when developing an application
with DemoGL: in frame X, which effects are visualising content and which soundstreams are hearable? in frame X+n, are
some effects removed or changed or new ones visible or hearable? This will result in clear effect descriptions and
sound descriptions. Don't be afraid to end up with say 20 or 30 different effects when you originally thought you
would have only 4 or 5. With this list, you can decide which of these different effects will become a CEffect derived
effect class and which will be created with different parameters but with the same logic of those effect classes.
After that, merge the different soundstreams with the effectclasses, or create new effectclasses to produce sound
effects if needed or use scriptcommands to start/stop soundeffects. 
<p>
When the CEffect derived classes are defined, implement the different CEffect methods and eventually new methods
needed. A more in-depth detailed description of all the CEffect methods can be found in <a href="ref_classes_CEffect.htm">CEffect</a>,
the DemoGL Reference manual description of CEffect.
<p>
Using these steps you'll end up with several classes of effectcode. Create instances (objects) of these classes, 
<a href="ref_functions_DEMOGL_EffectRegister.htm">register</a> the effects with DemoGL and start/stop the effects using
in code commands or a <a href="about_script.htm">script</a>. You'll soon notice that the amount of code you have to
produce is solely the effectcode, which what's all about, most of the time.
