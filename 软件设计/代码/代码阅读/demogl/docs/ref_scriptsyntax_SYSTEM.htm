<h4>_SYSTEM</h4>
Below are the definitions for all the commands which can be specified with the _SYSTEM object in the script.
You can add as much whitespace around commands and object names in the scriptcommands as you like, these will be 
stripped off anyway. 
<p>
All the commands below are prefixed with the timeline position in milliseconds when the command should be executed.
This timeline position can be negative, which means the command is executed prior application execution. All negative timeline events
are executed at once, prior to the start of the application, in the order on the timeline, so more negative times come first.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
60000;HIDE;1;
</pre>
<p>
This will hide layer 1 after 60000 milliseconds, or better: at timeline position 60 seconds.
<p>

<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>HIDE</b>
<pre>
_SYSTEM;HIDE;Layer number;
</pre>
<dd>Hides the layer with the number Layer number, which makes the effect on that layer invisible. The RenderFrame/RenderFrameEx methods are
	not called by DemoGL when an effect is placed on a layer that is not visible, i.e. hidden.
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Layer number</i>
	<dd>Specifies the number of the layer which should be hidden.<br>
		<b>Type:</b> long. Legal values are &gt;=0.
	</dl>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>SHOW</b>
<pre>
_SYSTEM;SHOW;Layer number;
</pre>
<dd>Shows the (hidden) layer with the number Layer number, which makes the effect on that layer visible. The RenderFrame/RenderFrameEx methods are
	called by DemoGL when an effect is placed on a layer that is visible.
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Layer number</i>
	<dd>Specifies the number of the layer which should be made visible.<br>
		<b>Type:</b> long. Legal values are &gt;=0.
	</dl>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>END</b>
<pre>
_SYSTEM;END;
</pre>
<dd>Ends the system. DemoGL will end itself and return to the calling code in the application, i.e. the code that called
	<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_AppRun</a>.
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>CAPTUREMOUSE</b>
<pre>
_SYSTEM;CAPTUREMOUSE;OnOff;
</pre>
<dd>Enables or disables the capturing of the mouse by the DemoGL application window. When switch ON, DemoGL will receive mouse related messages
	which can then be used to control visual effects. 
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><i>OnOff</i>
	<dd>Specifies if the mouse capturing should be ON or OFF.<br>
		<b>Type:</b> string. Legal values are ON and OFF.
	</dl>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>SETTIME</b>
<pre>
_SYSTEM;SETTIME;Time;
</pre>
<dd>Sets the current position on the timeline to Time milliseconds. This way you can start your application at any spot
	on the timeline.
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Time</i>
	<dd>Specifies the new timespot on the timeline.<br>
		<b>Type:</b> integer. Specified in milliseconds.
	</dl>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>RESTART</b>
<pre>
_SYSTEM;RESTART;Time;Re-initialize effects;Execute pre-Time effects;Kill sound;
</pre>
<dd>Restarts the application and will restart it on timeline position Time. You can use this command to
	make looping applications, so you can easily transform a multipart demo into a screensaver.
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Time</i>
	<dd>Specifies the timespot on the timeline where DemoGL should start the application again.<br>
		<b>Type:</b> integer. Specified in milliseconds.
	<dt><i>Re-initialize effects</i>
	<dd>Specifies if all Init() methods of all effects should be called before the application is restarted (1) or not (0).<br>
		<b>Type:</b> integer. Legal values are 0 and 1.
	<dt><i>Execute pre-Time effects</i>
	<dd>Specifies if all timeline events defined on the timeline with a timespot prior to <i>Time</i> should be executed (1) or not (0).<br>
		<b>Type:</b> integer. Legal values are 0 and 1.
	<dt><i>Kill sound</i>
	<dd>Specifies if all the playing sound channels should be removed when the application restarts (1) or not (0).
		Remove always current playing soundchannels when you configurate RESTART to re-execute scriptcommands that load and 
		play sound channels that are currently playing. (i.e.: always pass 1 for Kill sound, unless you want f.e. 1 music file playing
		looped while the application loops too but not in phase)<br>
		<b>Type:</b> integer. Legal values are 0 and 1.
