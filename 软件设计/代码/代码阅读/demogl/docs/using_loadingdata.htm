<h4>Loading data into your effectclasses.</h4>
In the topic <a HREF="using_creatingeffect.htm">Create an effectclass</a>, the class implemented, CSplash,
already loaded one file: logo.jpg. This was done in the Init() method of the effectclass, the right
place to put all the fileloading calls. The Init() methods are called before execution starts and don't need
any TLE's to get called, unlike the Prepare() method calls, so whenever possible, place calls to file loading
functions in the Init() method of your effectclasses.
<p>
Besides loading a texture using <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureLoad.htm">DEMOGL_TextureLoad</a> or loading
a soundfile using a _SOUNDSYSTEM related TLE in the application script, you can load any file you like using
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_FileLoad.htm">DEMOGL_FileLoad</a>. DEMOGL_FileLoad returns a pointer to the
block of memory containing the filedata. The pointer is a pointer to an unsigned char or byte, so if the data
in the file is of another type, first cast the pointer to that type. 
<p>
To get the length of the file, use another function: <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_FileGetLength.htm">DEMOGL_FileGetLength</a>. 
This function will return the length in bytes of the file specified. 
<p>
When you're done with the data you loaded from a file, it's wise to free up the memory the file occupies. Because DemoGL allocated
the memory, only DemoGL can free the memory. Do this by calling <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_FileFree.htm">DEMOGL_FileFree</a>.
Pass the pointer you received when calling DEMOGL_FileLoad to DEMOGL_FileFree and the memory is freed. When you loaded
a texture using DEMOGL_TextureLoad, you should use the function <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureDelete.htm">DEMOGL_TextureDelete</a>
to free up the data of the texture plus remove it from the texture store inside DemoGL. To free sound elements loaded with TLE's or
with API calls, use <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemFreeElement.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemFreeElement</a>. So every <i>loading</i>
functionality has its own <i>freeing</i> functionality.
