All sourcecode in this sourcecode package is released using the license below. Every
sourcefile in this package contains this license. Read it carefully before you modify
the sourcecode and/or add your code to the sourcecode. It's very important you understand
the license and what it means to you, the sourcecode and your work on the sourcecode. The
license is a way to tell users of the sourcecode what the limits are when they decide to use
the licensed work. By law the sourcecode is copyrighted and the copyright is held by the creator
of the work or the copyright holder where the work is based on. You can't change that by applying
a license nor changing a license, like this license. The license below helps you in defining the areas
wherein you are able to use/modify/re-distribute (parts of) the sourcecode in this package. 
<p>
It is recommended that when you modify the sourcecode or add additional code of your own and
you want to distribute the resulting sourcecode package, you include this license and any additional
license that is used by <b>your own</b> code. 
<p>
As a last note: the license restrictions seem small and full of holes. However, do not forget that
there is one thing that is much more important and it's been taken care of by Copyright Law: the
copyright. You cannot claim you wrote this code nor claim you own the copyright. Therefor this can't
be changed and it's omitted from the license. 
<p>
DemoGL uses ZLib, LibJpeg, BASS and some small classes from 3rd parties. Each of these elements have
different licenses. They are all free, except BASS, which is not free for noncommercial applications.
This license will <b>not</b> grant you another license for these 3rd party elements. Their licenses are still
valid for them. Keep that in mind when you start using the software provided.
