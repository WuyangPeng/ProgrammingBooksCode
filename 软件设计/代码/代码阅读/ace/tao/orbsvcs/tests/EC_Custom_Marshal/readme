	This example shows how to do custom marshaling of IDL and
non-IDL data structures in TAO, store the resulting CDR stream in an
octet sequence, send it to a remove server and then demarshal it.
	The example emphasize the use of efficient, non-copy
mechanisms to achieve those goals.

To run this test just start the Naming_Service, the Event_Service and then
start

$ ./ECM_Consumer

and after that

$ ./ECM_Supplier

you can vary the size of the payload (the number of elements in arrays
and sequences) using the -b option to the ECM_Supplier program.
