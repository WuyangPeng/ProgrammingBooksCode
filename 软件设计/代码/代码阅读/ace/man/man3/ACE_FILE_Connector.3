Default constructor.

Actively ``connect'' and produce a <new_io>  object if things go well. The <remote_sap> is the file that we are trying to create/open. If it's the default value of  then the user is letting the OS create the filename (via ). The <timeout> is the amount of time to wait to create/open the file. If it's 0 then we block indefinitely. If *timeout == {0, 0} then the file is created using non-blocking mode. In this case, if the create/open can't be done immediately the value of -1 is returned with <errno == EWOULDBLOCK>. If *timeout > {0, 0} then this is the maximum amount of time to wait before timing out. If the time expires before the connection is made <errno == ETIME>. The <local_sap> and <reuse_addr> parameters are ignored. The <flags> and <perms> arguments are passed down to the  method.
