.SS ACE_TLI_Connector::ACE_TLI_Connector (void)
.PP
Default constructor.

.PP
Actively connect and produce a <new_stream> if things go well. The <remote_sap> is the address that we are trying to connect with. The <timeout> is the amount of time to wait to connect. If it's 0 then we block indefinitely. If *timeout == {0, 0} then the connection is done using non-blocking mode. In this case, if the connection can't be made immediately the value of -1 is returned with <errno == EWOULDBLOCK>. If *timeout > {0, 0} then this is the maximum amount of time to wait before timing out. If the time expires before the connection is made <errno == ETIME>. The <local_sap> is the value of local address to bind to. If it's the default value of  then the user is letting the OS do the binding. If <reuse_addr> == 1 then the <local_addr> is reused, even if it hasn't been cleanedup yet.

.PP
Try to complete a non-blocking connection. If connection completion is successful then <new_stream> contains the connected \fBACE_SOCK_Stream\fR. If <remote_sap> is non-NULL then it will contain the address of the connected peer.

Dump the state of an object.
