 <author>The XFree86 Project, Inc
 <date>30 May 1997

<abstract>

This document describes the new features in XFree86 3.3 compared with the
previous full release, 3.2.  It also includes installation instructions
for the binary distributions.

</abstract>

<toc>

<sect> XFree86 and X11R6.3
<p>
XFree86 releases starting with the 3.2A beta are based on the
X Consortium's X11R6.3 (the final release from the X Consortium).

R6.3 is an update to R6.1, and is intended to be compatible with R6.1
and R6 at the source and protocol levels.  Binaries should be
upward-compatible.  X11R6.3 includes some new Xserver extensions:
SECURITY, XC-APPGROUP, XpExtension (print extension), and an updated,
and standardised version of LBX.  X11R6.3 also has new standards,
including RX (X Remote Execution MIME type), and a proxy management
protocol.  X11R6.3 includes support for gzipped fonts.

R6.1 is an update to R6,
and is intended to be compatible with R6 at the source and protocol
levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.  X11R6.1 includes some
new Xserver extensions: DOUBLE-BUFFER, XKEYBOARD and RECORD.

What about R6.2?  X11R6.2 is the name given to a subset of X11R6.3,
which has only the print extension and the Xlib implementation of
vertical writing and user-defined character support in addition to
those features included in R6.1.
<p>
<sect> OS issues
<p>
Always check the OS specific README files for special requirements or caveats. 
<p>
Users running Linux/Elf (on Intel platforms) should note that they will
need ld.so version 1.7.14 or later.  This
can be found at <htmlurl name="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC"
url="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC">.
<p>
Note: Elf is now the only binary type supported for Linux OSs.  This means
that binaries for ix86/a.out and AXP/ECOFF are not available with this
release.

<sect> New Features in 3.3
<p>
<sect1> General
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>XFree86 3.3 includes the X Consortium's X11R6.3.
</itemize>
<sect1> General X server changes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The X servers include a new DPMS extension, which was donated by
	Digital Equipment Corporation.  Not all DPMS modes have been
	implemented by all servers yet, but this should improve in future
	releases.  See the XF86Config(4/5) and xset(1) man pages
	for further details.
  <item>The LBX extension is included in all the X servers, as part of the
	update to R6.3.
  <item>A print-only server (Xprt) is included as part of the update to R6.3.
  <item>Some bugs in the Type1 font code have been fixed.
  <item>Some bugs in newer functions in the XFree86 VidMode extension
	have been fixed.
  <item>Support has been added for the Microsoft IntelliMouse.
</itemize>
<sect1> XF86Setup
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Some bugs have been fixed, but no major changes have been made
	to this version.
  <item>More modelines were added. There are now high-refresh versions of
	most common modes available (85 and 100 Hz). 512x384, 1152x864,
	1600x1200 and 1800x1440 modes were added.
</itemize>
<sect1> PC98 Support
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The XF98_TGUI server includes XAA support, but there are some problems
	with this at the moment.  It can be disabled with the "noaccel"
	option.
</itemize>
<sect1> Alpha (AXP) platform support
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for the S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX is now available.
  <item>Support for "newmmio" is now available for the S3 868/968/Trio64V+
	and is enabled by default (use chipset "mmio_928" to get the old
	behaviour).
  <item>Support for the Matrox Millennium and Mystique (in the SVGA server)
	is included.
  <item>Support for the Trident driver (in the SVGA server) is included.
  <item>Some problems that showed up with Netscape on some servers have
	been fixed.
  <item>Various alignment problems have been fixed.
  <item>NOTE: A recent Linux kernel version is required for most of these
	servers (essential for the Matrox driver).
  <item>Scanpci now works on Alpha platforms.
</itemize>
<sect1> XInput Extension
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Multiple input devices can share the core pointer.

<itemize>
  <item>An improved layout for Russian keyboards is provided.
  <item>A layout for Hungarian keyboards is provided.
</itemize>
<sect1> SVGA server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>A new general graphics acceleration interface (XFree86 Acceleration
	Architecture - XAA) has been implemented.  It is used to provide
	relatively complete acceleration, at different colour depths,
	for several chips in the SVGA server.  Chips currently making use
	of this include the Matrox Millennium, Mystique, Tseng ET4000/W32p
	and ET6000,
	and several chips from ARK Logic, Chips and Technologies, Cirrus,
	Trident, SiS and the S3 ViRGE family.
  <item>The SVGA server now includes a driver for the S3 ViRGE family. It 
        supports the ViRGE, ViRGE/DX, ViRGE/GX and ViRGE/VX. This driver is
        a completely new implementation, so please send in success/failure
        reports.
</itemize>
<sect1> S3 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Some further S3 968 hardware bugs for lines/text have been worked
	around.
  <item>Cursor/pointer pixmaps larger than 64x64 are now supported without
	the need to use the "sw_cursor" option.
  <item>Detection/support for the Trio64UV+, Trio64V2 (including the /DX and
        /GX versions), Aurora64V+ (86CM65 used in notebooks), and Plato/PX
        is now included.  This support is
	very new and hasn't had much testing, so please send us
	success/failure reports.
  <item>Support is now included for the ELSA Winner 2000PRO/X-8.  Please
	refer to the notes for this card in <htmlurl url="S3.html"
	name="README.S3">.
  <item>Support is now included for the MIRO 80SV.
  <item>A bug which prevented DGA apps from setting the ViewPort to the lower
	part of the framebuffer has been fixed (this showed up most commonly
	with 4MB cards).
</itemize>
<sect1> S3V (ViRGE) server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support has been added for the ViRGE/DX and ViRGE/GX.
  <item>Problems with the Diamond Stealth 3D 3000 are now fixed.
  <item>The line drawing code has been improved.
  <item>Packed 24bpp support is included, and should be improved
	over earlier versions.
  <item>The S3V server translates between sparse 32bpp pixmaps and packed
	24bpp for the framebuffer.  In some cases this can be slow.
  <item>32bpp framebuffer format is not supported.
</itemize>
<sect1> Mach64 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for 3D Rage II based Mach64 cards is included.
  <item>Various problems with support for some revisions of CT, VT and GT
	chipsets have been fixed.
  <item>It is strongly recommended that all users with CT, VT, GT and
	3D Rage II based Mach64 cards upgrade to the 3.3 release due
	to the problems that were fixed.
</itemize>
<sect1> Mach32 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>A bug that causes problems when running XF86Setup with cards with
	less than 2MB of video memory has been fixed.
  <item>Minor shifts in maximum clock rate under 16 bpp, and inclusion of
        explicit 15 "bpp" setting.
</itemize>
<sect1> W32 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>In this version, the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not
	undergone any significant changes. In fact, it is not being
	developed further. Instead, the SVGA server (XF86_SVGA) is now the
	main focus of new developments. See the W32 (SVGA) description.
</itemize>
<!--
<sect1> AGX server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>stuff...
</itemize>
-->
<sect1> P9000 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for PCI probing has been added.
  <item>DPMS support has been added.
</itemize>
<sect1> I128 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Some preliminary acceleration (for bitblts) is included.
	This code is very new, and hasn't been extensively tested yet.
</itemize>
<sect1> TGA server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Preliminary acceleration support is included, using XAA.
  <item>Various bugs have been fixed.
</itemize>
<sect1> Trident driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Acceleration support has been added for the 9320, 9440 and 96xx chips.
  <item>Support for the Cyber series of laptop chips has been improved.
  <item>24/32bpp support has been added for some chips.
  <item>Some clock limits have been fixed.
</itemize>
<sect1> Ark driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>More complete acceleration has been implemented using XAA,
	including line draw, fill, and text acceleration, at different
	colour depths.
</itemize>
<sect1> W32 driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The SVGA server now supports acceleration for the most recent
	ET4000W32 chips. In 3.3, the ET4000W32p chips are now fully
	accelerated, and also support the higher performing linear memory
	layout (read the tseng README file for more information: there are a
	few problems).
  <item>VESA DPMS (monitor power saving) support was added.
  <item>There is now support for more than 256 colors on most ET4000W32i and
	ET4000W32p chips. This means 15, 16, 24 and/or 32 bits per pixel
	modes (32768, 65536 or 16 million colors) are supported on most
	common RAMDACs. On the W32p, these modes are accelerated. On the
	W32i, there is no acceleration in any mode. For accelerated support
	on W32i chips, refer to the separate W32 server (XF86_W32).
  <item>A few bugs in XFree86 3.2 and 3.2A have been fixed. Most importantly
	the failure to probe some PCI cards has been resolved.
  <item>Fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards,
	floppy-tape drives)
  <item>Support for the Chrontel RAMDAC has been added.
</itemize>
<sect1> ET6000 driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The ET6000 driver in the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not
	changed significantly.
  <item>On the other hand, the ET6000 driver in the SVGA server, which
	already existed in XFree86 3.2 for all color depths, is now fully
	accelerated for all those color depths. It builds upon the new XAA
	architecture, which is the cornerstone of a new acceleration
	framework within the XFree86 servers. It is responsible for the
	outstanding acceleration performance of this release.
  <item>Many small problems which existed in the initial 3.2 release have
	been solved. Screen noise, flicker or instability at higher pixel
	clocks are mostly fixed. Some detection problems are gone. Weird
	behaviour (jumping and screen wrap) when panning through large
	virtual desktops has been fixed. The server now detects the correct
	amount of memory on ET6000 cards with 2.25 MB of MDRAM. More
	realistic pixel clock rate limits have been put in place, to avoid
	modes that would cause screen problems.
  <item>DPMS support was added.
  <item>The ET6000 hardware cursor is now supported. Read the Tseng
	documentation file for more information (there are a few
	limitations)
  <item>fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards,
	floppy-tape drives)
</itemize>
<sect1> Alliance ProMotion driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The driver now recognises the AT24 chipset, but it is treated
	the same way as the AP6422.

<sect>Installing the XFree86 3.3 Release
<p>
The XFree86 3.3 binaries are distributed as a full release,
not as an upgrade.

What follows is a list of the XFree86 3.3 components.  There may be
some variations in this for some OSs.

The following are required for all installations:
<quote>
<verb>
preinst.sh      Pre-installation script
postinst.sh     Post-installation script
X33bin.tgz      Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
X33doc.tgz      Documentation
X33fnts.tgz     75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
X33lib.tgz      Data files required at run-time
X33man.tgz      Manual pages
X33set.tgz      XF86Setup utility
X33VG16.tgz     16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)
</verb>
</quote>

The following is required for new installations, and optional for existing
installations:
<quote>
<verb>
X33cfg.tgz      sample config files for xinit, xdm
</verb>
</quote>

NOTE: Be very careful about installing X33cfg.tgz over an existing
installation if you have customised your xinit and/or xdm config files.
Installing X33cfg.tgz will overwrite any existing files.  If you do have
customised files, there is no need to install X33cfg.tgz.

NOTE: The bitmap fonts distributed with this release are compressed using
gzip rather than compress.  This means that you will probably want to
remove the old versions (after backing them up).  The Xservers and font
server in previous releases cannot read gzipped fonts, so keep a copy
of the old fonts if you wish to run older servers.

The following X servers are for PC/AT based hardware (i.e., typical
Intel ix86 based PCs).  Choose at least one which
matches your hardware, as well as the VGA16 server.  The VGA16 server is
required by the new configuration utility (XF86Setup).

If you already have a version of XFree86 installed, <bf>MAKE A BACKUP OF</bf>
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> <bf>BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE</bf>.  The standard
installation procedure will overwrite your existing version of XFree86.

If you are installing from scratch, create a directory called
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, then extract the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files.
If you don't have enough space in <tt>/usr</tt> for this, create a
directory elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it.
E.g., if you create a directory in <tt>/home</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
	mkdir /home/X11R6
	ln -s /home/X11R6 /usr
</verb></tscreen>

The next step is to run the pre-installation script.  This script makes
some preliminary checks of your system.  For some OSs, it may tell you
to install new versions of some system components before proceeding with
the installation.  This script may also remove some outdated files and
symbolic links from a previous installation that could cause problems.

Copy the <tt>preinst.sh</tt> script to
<tt>/var/tmp</tt>, then go to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and run it:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt>.tgz</tt> files are gzipped tar files.  To extract them, go to
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, and run the following as <bf>root</bf> for each
file you need:
<tscreen><verb>
	gzip -d < X33file.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>
On some OSs, you might get some "Broken Pipe" messages.  Providing there
are no other messages associated with this, they can be safely ignored.
Note: You should not be running X while doing this installation.  Doing
so may cause the installation to fail, or cause your X session to crash.

If you are using NetBSD or FreeBSD, a more reliable (and highly recommended)
way of doing this is to extract the <tt>.tgz</tt> files with:
<tscreen><verb>
        gzip -d < X33file.tgz | tar -v -x --unlink -f -
</verb></tscreen>

If you have GNU cpio (as Linux does) or SVR4 cpio, a more reliable (and
highly recommended) way of doing this is to extract the <tt>.tgz</tt>
files with:
<tscreen><verb>
	gzip -d < X33file.tgz | cpio -i -v -d -u -H ustar
</verb></tscreen>

Once the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files have been extracted, copy the
<tt>postinst.sh</tt> script to <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, then go to
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and run it:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/postinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

For OSs which use ldconfig (like Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD), you
should either run ldconfig or reboot to complete the installation.
Some Linux releases don't run ldconfig automatically at reboot, so you
may need to run it manually.
If you are using FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD, and your version of ldconfig
supports the <tt>-m</tt> option, you can run:
<tscreen><verb>
	ldconfig -m /usr/X11R6/lib
</verb></tscreen>
Otherwise for these OSs, check <tt>/etc/rc</tt> to see how ldconfig gets
run at boot time.
