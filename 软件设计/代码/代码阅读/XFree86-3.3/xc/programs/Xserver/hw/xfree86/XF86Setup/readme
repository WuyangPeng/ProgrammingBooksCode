                               ----------------

INTRODUCTION

   XF86Setup is a new program to aid in the configuration of the XFree86
   servers. It is unlike previous programs (such as ConfigXF86 and
   xf86config) in that it is specifically designed to do as much as
   possible while in graphics mode.

   However, xf86config is _not_ being replaced. XF86Setup's resource
   requirements are considerably greater than those of xf86config. It also
   is not usable for OS/2 configuration (at least not yet).

   XF86Setup requires that both the VGA16 and card-appropriate servers be
   installed. Furthermore, the servers must include the XKEYBOARD,
   XFree86-VidModeExtension, and XFree86-Misc extensions. If the dialog
   program is installed, it will be used, but is not required.

   If you wish to run XF86Setup without installing it first, you need to
   set the environment variable "XF86SETUPLIB" to point to the source
   directory.

   The command line options are documented in the XF86Setup man page. For
   instructions regarding the use of the program, see the Quick Start Guide
   to XFree86 Configuration and the on-line help.

   The rest of this file contains information that is mainly of use to
   someone interested in hacking on the code.

                         combobox widget

NEW TCL COMMANDS

   The program includes a Tcl interpreter which has been extended with
   additional commands (in addition to those in the Tk toolkit). They are
   explained below.

Interfacing with the Cards database

   Two commands have been added to read data from the "Cards" database (as
   used by "xf86config")
     xf86cards_getlist   Return the full list of card names
     xf86cards_getentry  Get complete info on a card

   A valid card name should be supplied as an argument to
   "xf86cards_getentry"

XFree86-VidModeExtension commands

   Several commands have been added which allow the program to communicate
   with the XFree86-VidModeExtension server extension, namely:
     xf86vid_getversion  Query extension version
     xf86vid_getbasevals
                         Get the ErrorBase and EventBase
     xf86vid_getmodeline
                         Get the current video mode settings
     xf86vid_getallmodelines
                         Get video settings for all modes
     xf86vid_getmonitor  Get monitor specs
     xf86vid_lockmodeswitch
                         Turn on/off mode switching
     xf86vid_switchmode  Switch to next/previous mode

   Only the last two take an argument, which is either "lock" or "unlock"
   in the case of "xf86vid_lockmodeswitch" and either "next" or "prev" in
   the case of "xf86vid_switchmode".

   "xf86vid_getversion" returns the version as a floating point number
   (e.g., 1.2), whereas "xf86vid_getbasevals" returns a Tcl list containing
   two elements.

   The "xf86vid_getmodeline" command returns a string which contains the
   standard mode line values including flags, if any, with each value
   separated by a single space.

   "xf86vid_getallmodelines" returns a Tcl list. The number of elements
   corresponds to the number of valid video modes. Each element is in the
   format returned by "xf86vid_getmodeline". The first element contains the
   mode info for the current mode.

   "xf86vid_getmonitor" also returns a Tcl list. The first element is the
   vendor name. The second is the model name. The third element contains
   all of the horizontal sync rates as comma separated ranges (so for
   example if the sync rates were 31.5, 35-40, and 45-55 the return value
   would be: "31.50-31.50,35.00-40.00,45.00-55.00"). The last element
   contains the vertical sync rates in the same format.

XFree86-Misc extension commands

   Communication with the XFree86-Misc extension is possible using these
   new commands:
     xf86misc_getversion
                         Query extension version
     xf86misc_getbasevals
                         Get the ErrorBase and EventBase
     xf86misc_getmouse   Get the current mouse settings
     xf86misc_setmouse   Set the current mouse settings
     xf86misc_getkeyboard
                         Get the current keyboard settings
     xf86misc_setkeyboard
                         Set the current keyboard settings
     xf86misc_getsaver   Get the power saver settings
     xf86misc_setsaver   Set the power saver settings

XKEYBOARD extension commands

   A few commands are available for communicating with the XKEYBOARD
   extension:
     xkb_components      List the components that make up the given
                         keyboard
     xkb_free            Free a previously allocated keyboard description
                         structure
     xkb_getrulesprop    Read the _XKB_RULES_NAMES root property
     xkb_list            Returns a list of available components
     xkb_listrules       Returns a list of available rules defs and their
                         descriptions
     xkb_load            Change the keyboard setup for the specified
                         components
     xkb_read            Get keyboard information from the server
     xkb_setrulesprop    Set the _XKB_RULES_NAMES root property
     xkb_resolvecomponents
                         Use the XKB rules to determine the components
                         necessay for an appropriate keymap (requires XKB
                         library support that might not yet be in the
                         XFree86 tree).

   The xkbview widget is also available as interface to the xkbui library.

Miscellaneous

   Other commands added to the interpreter are:
     getuid              Returns the real uid of the user
     server_running      Returns true if a server is running on the
                         specified display
     process_running     Checks if the specified process is running
     has_symlinks        Returns true if running on an OS that supports
                         symbolic links
     link                Makes a (soft or hard) link from one file to
                         another
     unlink              Removes the specified file
     mkdir               Create the named directory
     rmdir               Remove the named directory
     umask               Set the file creation mode mask
     sleep               Sleeps for the specified number of seconds
     findfocuswindow     Search along an axis for a window which accepts
                         focus (added to the interpreter after Tk has been
                         initialized)

   "getuid" just returns the numeric result of getuid().

   The "server_running" command simply tries to perform an "XOpenDisplay()"
   on its argument. If the call fails, it returns false (0), otherwise it
   calls "XCloseDisplay()" and returns true (1).
