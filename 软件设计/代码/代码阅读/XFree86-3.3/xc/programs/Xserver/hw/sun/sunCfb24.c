/*
 * The CG8 is similar to the CG4 in that it has a mono plane, an enable 
 * plane, and a color plane. While the CG4 only has an 8-bit color
 * plane the CG8 has a 24-bit color plane. 
 *
 * If you have a CG4 you know that you can switch between the mono and
 * the color screens merely by dragging the pointer off the edge of the
 * screen, causing the other screen to be switched in. However this is
 * the cause of some consternation on the part of those people who have
 * both a CG4 and another frame buffer.
 *
 * Because of this problem, and some other considerations, I have chosen
 * to ignore the mono plane of the CG8 in this code.
