<sect>DEC 21030
<p>
<itemize>
<item>The DEC 21030 is supported by XFree86 in this release of XFree86 3.3.

<item>Current Known Problems

<enum>
<item>Only one modeline is accepted, this will be the first viable one
that matches other criteria.

<item>Due to the above, Virtual Resolutions is not supported either.

<item>VideoRam is currently limited to 2MB.

<item>The 8plane 21030 is currently the only supported chipset. I don't
have access to the 24plane or the 24plane3D chip.
</enum>

<item>The following options may be specified for the 21030 driver:
<descrip>
<tag>Option &dquot;dac_8_bit&dquot;</tag>
	Turn on 8Bit BT485 RamDac.
<tag>Option &dquot;dac_6_bit&dquot;</tag>
	Turn on 6Bit BT485 RamDac.
<tag>MemBase &dquot;0x???????&dquot;</tag>
	If the server does not detect the base address of the 21030, then
	Check /proc/pci for the 21030 and look for the "Prefetchable 32 bit
	memory at 0x???????" and enter this as your MemBase setting.

</descrip>
<item>No acceleration features of the 21030 have been taken advantage of yet!
</itemize>

<sect> Additional Notes <p>
The code for the 21030 as yet - has only been tested on DEC's UDB box, better
known as the Multia, in a Linux environment.
