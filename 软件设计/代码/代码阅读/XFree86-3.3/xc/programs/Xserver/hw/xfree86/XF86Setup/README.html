<H1>XF86Setup README</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

  <P>XF86Setup is a new program to aid in the configuration of the
  XFree86 servers.  It is unlike previous programs (such as ConfigXF86
  and xf86config) in that it is specifically designed to do as much
  as possible while in graphics mode.
  <P>However, xf86config is <EM>not</EM> being replaced.  XF86Setup's
  resource requirements are considerably greater than those of
  xf86config.  It also is not usable for OS/2 configuration
  (at least not yet).
  <P>XF86Setup requires that both the VGA16 and card-appropriate servers
  be installed.  Furthermore, the servers must include the XKEYBOARD,
  XFree86-VidModeExtension, and XFree86-Misc extensions.  If the
  dialog program is installed, it will be used, but is not required.

  <P>If you wish to run XF86Setup without installing it first,
  you need to set the environment variable
  <KBD>XF86SETUPLIB</KBD> to point to the source directory.

  <P>The command line options are documented in the XF86Setup man
  page.  For instructions regarding the use of the program, see the
  <A HREF="http://www.XFree86.org/3.1.2G/QuickStart.html">Quick Start Guide to XFree86 Configuration</A>
  and the on-line help.

  <P>The rest of this file contains information that is mainly of
  use to someone interested in hacking on the code.

  </DL>

<H2>New Tcl commands</H2>
  
  <P>The program includes a Tcl interpreter which has been extended
  with additional commands (in addition to those in the Tk toolkit).
  They are explained below.

<H3>Interfacing with the Cards database</H3>

  <P>Two commands have been added to read data from the
  <CITE>Cards</CITE> database (as used by <CITE>xf86config</CITE>)
  <DL>
    <DT>xf86cards_getlist      <DD>Return the full list of card names
    <DT>xf86cards_getentry     <DD>Get complete info on a card
  </DL>
  <P>A valid card name should be supplied as an argument to
  <KBD>xf86cards_getentry</KBD>

<H3>XFree86-VidModeExtension commands</H3>

  <P>Several commands have been added which allow the program to
  communicate with the XFree86-VidModeExtension server extension,
  namely:
  <DL>
    <DT>xf86vid_getversion      <DD>Query extension version
    <DT>xf86vid_getbasevals     <DD>Get the ErrorBase and EventBase
    <DT>xf86vid_getmodeline     <DD>Get the current video mode settings
    <DT>xf86vid_getallmodelines <DD>Get video settings for all modes
    <DT>xf86vid_getmonitor      <DD>Get monitor specs
    <DT>xf86vid_lockmodeswitch  <DD>Turn on/off mode switching
    <DT>xf86vid_switchmode      <DD>Switch to next/previous mode
  </DL>
  <P>Only the last two take an argument, which is either <KBD>lock</KBD>
  or <KBD>unlock</KBD> in the case of <KBD>xf86vid_lockmodeswitch</KBD>
  and either <KBD>next</KBD> or <KBD>prev</KBD> in the case of
  <KBD>xf86vid_switchmode</KBD>.
  <P><KBD>xf86vid_getversion</KBD> returns the version as a floating
  point number (e.g., 1.2), whereas <KBD>xf86vid_getbasevals</KBD>
  returns a Tcl list containing two elements.
  <P>The <KBD>xf86vid_getmodeline</KBD> command returns a string
  which contains the standard mode line values including flags,
  if any, with each value separated by a single space.
  <P><KBD>xf86vid_getallmodelines</KBD> returns a Tcl list.  The
  number of elements corresponds to the number of valid video
  modes.  Each element is in the format returned by
  <KBD>xf86vid_getmodeline</KBD>. The first element contains the
  mode info for the current mode.
  <P><KBD>xf86vid_getmonitor</KBD> also returns a Tcl list.  The
  first element is the vendor name. The second is the model name.
  The third element contains all of the horizontal sync rates
  as comma separated ranges (so for example if the sync rates
  were 31.5, 35-40, and 45-55 the return value would be:
  <KBD>31.50-31.50,35.00-40.00,45.00-55.00</KBD>). The last element
  contains the vertical sync rates in the same format.

<H3>XFree86-Misc extension commands</H3>

  <P>Communication with the XFree86-Misc extension is possible
  using these new commands:
  <DL>
    <DT>xf86misc_getversion      <DD>Query extension version
    <DT>xf86misc_getbasevals     <DD>Get the ErrorBase and EventBase
    <DT>xf86misc_getmouse        <DD>Get the current mouse settings
    <DT>xf86misc_setmouse        <DD>Set the current mouse settings
    <DT>xf86misc_getkeyboard     <DD>Get the current keyboard settings
    <DT>xf86misc_setkeyboard     <DD>Set the current keyboard settings
    <DT>xf86misc_getsaver        <DD>Get the power saver settings
    <DT>xf86misc_setsaver        <DD>Set the power saver settings
  </DL>

<H3>XKEYBOARD extension commands</H3>

  <P>A few commands are available for communicating with the XKEYBOARD
  extension:
  <DL>
    <DT>xkb_components         <DD>List the components that make up the
				   given keyboard
    <DT>xkb_free               <DD>Free a previously allocated keyboard
				   description structure
    <DT>xkb_getrulesprop       <DD>Read the _XKB_RULES_NAMES root property
    <DT>xkb_list               <DD>Returns a list of available components
    <DT>xkb_listrules          <DD>Returns a list of available rules
				   defs and their descriptions
    <DT>xkb_load               <DD>Change the keyboard setup for the
				   specified components
    <DT>xkb_read               <DD>Get keyboard information from the
				   server
    <DT>xkb_setrulesprop       <DD>Set the _XKB_RULES_NAMES root property
    <DT>xkb_resolvecomponents  <DD>Use the XKB rules to determine the
				   components necessay for an
				   appropriate keymap (requires XKB
				   library support that might not yet
				   be in the XFree86 tree).
  </DL>
  <P>The xkbview widget is also available as interface to the xkbui library.

<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>

  <P>Other commands added to the interpreter are:
  <DL>
    <DT>getuid                 <DD>Returns the real uid of the user
    <DT>server_running         <DD>Returns true if a server is
                                   running on the specified display
    <DT>process_running        <DD>Checks if the specified process is running
    <DT>has_symlinks           <DD>Returns true if running on an OS
				   that supports symbolic links
    <DT>link                   <DD>Makes a (soft or hard) link from
				   one file to another
    <DT>unlink                 <DD>Removes the specified file
    <DT>mkdir                  <DD>Create the named directory
    <DT>rmdir                  <DD>Remove the named directory
    <DT>umask                  <DD>Set the file creation mode mask
    <DT>sleep                  <DD>Sleeps for the specified number
                                   of seconds
    <DT>findfocuswindow        <DD>Search along an axis for a window which
				   accepts focus (added to the interpreter
				   after Tk has been initialized)
  </DL>
  <P><KBD>getuid</KBD> just returns the numeric result of getuid().
  <P>The <KBD>server_running</KBD> command simply tries to perform
  an <KBD>XOpenDisplay()</KBD> on its argument.  If the call fails,
  it returns false (0), otherwise it calls <KBD>XCloseDisplay()</KBD>
  and returns true (1).
