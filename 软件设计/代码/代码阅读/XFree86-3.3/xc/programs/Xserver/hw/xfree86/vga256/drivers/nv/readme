XFree driver for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 v1.0
======================================================

This is the first release of a driver for the above chips. This driver 
has very basic functionality, and does not use the accelerated features of 
the chip. 

Notes
-----

* THE DRIVER DOES NOT SUPPORT THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP FEATURES OF XFREE86 
This is because the NV1 does not have the necessary hardware to support this
feature. If you want to change resolutions, you will have to modify your 
config file. Comment out all but the mode you wish to use.

* The NV1 only supports a 555 RGB Weight in 16 bpp, the hardware does
not do 565. You must put a Weight 555 in the Display section.

* 24/32 bpp mode is not yet supported.

Known Bugs 
---------- 

* Corruption of a single pixel in 8bpp mode when switching VC's

* The driver should force Weight 555 in 16 bpp mode
