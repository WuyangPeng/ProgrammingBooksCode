<sect> Introduction <p>

The Chips and Technologies ct655xx range of chips are primarily
manufactured for use in laptop computers, where their power
conservation circuitry is of importance. They can however be found in
a few "<tt>Green</tt>" video cards for desktop machines. Prior to
the release of XFree 3.2, XFree contained only limited support for
these chipsets. The support that was introduced in XFree3.1.1 was not
capable of linear addressing or using the programmable clocks in the
ct65535 and later chips. In addition to these chipsets the new driver
supports the WinGine ct643xx series of chips and gives limited support
to the WinGine ct642xx chips.

The driver has been almost completely rewritten, with many additional
features added. These include

<itemize>
<item>Linear Addressing
<item>16/ 24 bits per pixel
<item>Fully programmable clocks are supported
<item>H/W cursor support
<item>BitBLT acceleration of many operations
</itemize>

With the latest release of XFree, the Chips and Technologies driver 
supports the new XAA acceleration interface. This should improve
the graphics performance particularly at higher depths or for the
newer chips.

<sect> Supported Chips <p>
<descrip>
<tag>ct65520</tag>
	(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 68MHz@5V)
<tag>ct65525</tag>
        This chip is basically identical to the 65530. It has the same
	ID and is identified as a 65530 when probed. See ct65530 for
	details.
<tag>ct65530</tag>
	This is a very similar chip to the 65520. However it additionally
	has the ability for mixed 5V and 3.3V operation and linear addressing
	of the video memory.
	(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 56MHz@3.3V, 68MHz@5V)
<tag>ct65535</tag>
	This is the first chip of the ct655xx series to support fully
	programmable clocks. Otherwise it has the the same properties
	as the 65530.
<tag>ct65540</tag>
	This is the first version of the of the ct655xx that was capable
	of supporting Hi-Color and True-Color. It also includes a fully
	programmable dot clock and supports all types of flat panels.
	(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 56MHz@3.3V, 68MHz@5V)
<tag>ct65545</tag>
	The chip is very similar to the 65540, with the addition of H/W
	cursor, pop-menu acceleration, BitBLT and support of PCI Buses.
	PCI version also allow all the BitBLT and H/W cursor registers
	to be memory mapped 2Mb above the Base Address.
	(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 56MHz@3.3V,68MHz@5V)
<tag>ct65546</tag>
	This chip is specially manufactured for Toshiba, and so documentation
	is not widely available. It is believed that this is really just a
	65545 with a higher maximum dot-clock of 80MHz.
	(Max Ram: 1Mb?, Max Dclk: 80MHz?)
<tag>ct65548</tag>
	This chip is similar to the 65545, but it also includes XRAM support
	and supports the higher dot clocks of the 65546. 
	(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz)
<tag>ct65550/ct65554</tag>
	These chips are a completely new architecture to previous ct655xx
	chips. They include many new features, including improved BitBLT
	support (24bpp color expansion, wider maximum pitch, etc), Multimedia
	unit (video capture, zoom video port, etc) and 24bpp uncompressed true
	color (i.e 32bpp mode). Also memory mapped I/O is possible on all bus
	configurations. There is only limited support for H/W acceleration at
	this point.
	(Max Ram: 4Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz@3.3V,110MHz@5V)
<tag>ct64200</tag>
	This chip, also known as the WinGine, is used in video cards
        for desktop systems. It often uses external DAC's and programmable
	clock chips to supply additional functionally. None of these are
	currently supported within the driver itself, so many cards will only
	have limited support. Linear addressing is not supported for this
	card in the driver.
	(Max Ram: 2Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz)
<tag>ct64300</tag>
	This is a more advanced version of the WinGine chip, with specification
	very similar to the 6554x series of chips. However there are many
	difference at a register level. A similar level of acceleration to
	the 65545 is included for this driver.
	(Max Ram: 2Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz)

<sect> XF86Config Options <p>

The following options are of particular interest to the Chips
and Technologies ct655xx driver.  Each of them must be specified in the
`svga' driver section of the XF86Config file, within the Screen
subsections of the depths to which they are applicable (you can enable
options for all depths by specifying them in the Device section).

<descrip>
<tag>
Option &dquot;noaccel&dquot;
</tag>
        This option will disable the use of any accelerated functions.
        This is likely to help with some problems related to DRAM
        timing, high dot clocks, and bugs in accelerated functions, at
        the cost of performance (which will still be reasonable on VLB/PCI).
<tag>
Option &dquot;no_bitblt&dquot; (Chips 65545 and later)
</tag>
        This option will disable the use of the BitBLT engine which the
	65545 and above have. If you can use the  "<tt>noaccel</tt>" option
	to correct a problem, then this option might be better to use.
	It still allows the use of generic speedups.
<tag>
Option &dquot;xaa_no_color_exp&dquot; (Chips 65545 and later)
</tag>
	This option will have the effect of disabling the use
	of monochrome colour expansion. In particular this effects
	text and bitmaps. It is useful for problems related to image writes,
	and possible acceleration problems. In general this will result in
	a reduced performance. Note that this option replaces the 
	"<tt>no_imageblt</tt>" option used in XFree 3.2.
<tag>
Option &dquot;xaa_benchmark&dquot; (Chips 65545 and later)
</tag>
	Turns on the XAA acceleration benchmarks. Information regarding
	what graphics primitives are accelerated and their relatives
	speeds will be printed when the X server starts.
<tag>
videoram 1024 (or another value)
</tag>
        This option will override the detected amount of video memory,
        and pretend the given amount of memory is present on the card.
	Note that many ct655xx chips only allow up to 1Mb of videoram,
	and the amount should be correctly detected.
<tag>
Option &dquot;nolinear&dquot; (Chips 65530 and later)
</tag>
	By default linear addressing is used on all ct655xx chips.
	However this might be broken in some implementations. It
	is possible to turn the linear addressing off with this
	option. Note that H/W acceleration and 16/24bpp are only
	supported with linear addressing.
<tag>
MemBase 0x03b00000 (or a different address)
</tag>
        This sets the physical memory base address of the linear
        framebuffer. Typically this is probed correctly, but if
	you believe it to be mis-probed, this option might help.
	Also for non PCI machines specifying this force the linear base
	address to be this value, reprogramming the video processor
	to suit. Note that for the 65530 this is required as the
	base address can't be correctly probed.
<tag>
Option &dquot;sw_cursor&dquot; (Chips 65545 and later)
</tag>
        This disables use of the hardware cursor provided by the chip.
        Try this if the cursor seems to have problems. 
<tag>
Option &dquot;STN&dquot;
</tag>
	The server is unable to differentiate between SS STN 
 	and TFT displays. This forces it to identify the display
	as a SS STN rather than a TFT.
<tag>
Option &dquot;use_modeline&dquot;
</tag>
	The flat panel timings are related to the panel size and not the
	size of the mode specified in XF86Config. For this reason the
	default behaviour of the server is to use the panel timings already
	installed in the chip. The user can force the panel timings to be
	recalculated from the modeline with this option. However the panel
	size will still be probed.
<tag>
Option &dquot;fix_panel_size&dquot;
</tag>
	For some machines the LCD panel size is incorrectly probed from
	the registers. This option forces the LCD panel size to be
	overridden by the modeline display sizes. This will prevent the
	use of a mode that is a different size than the panel. Before
	using this check that the server reports an incorrect panel
	size. This option can be used in conjunction with the option
	&dquot;use_modeline&dquot; to program all the panel timings using
	the modeline values.
<tag>
Option &dquot;no_stretch&dquot;
</tag>
	When the size of the mode used is less than the panel size, the
	default behaviour of the server is to stretch the mode in an attempt
	to fill the screen. A "<tt>letterbox</tt>" effect with no stretching
	can be achieved using this option.
<tag>
Option &dquot;lcd_center&dquot;
</tag>
	When the size of the mode used is less than the panel size, the
	default behaviour of the server is to align the left hand edge of
	the display with the left hand edge of the screen. Using this option
	the mode can be centered in the screen. This option is reported to
	have problems with some machines at 16/24bpp, the effect of which
	is that the right-hand edge of the mode will be pushed off the screen.
<tag>
Option &dquot;hw_clocks&dquot; (Chips 65535 and later)
</tag>
	On chips 65535 and later, the default is to use the programmable
	clock for all clocks. It is possible to use the fixed clocks
	supported by the chip instead by using this option. Typically
	this will give you some or all of the clocks 25.175, 28.322,
	31.000 and 36.000MHz. The current programmable clock will be
	given as the last clock in the list. On a cold-booted system this
	might be the appropriate value to use at the text console (see the 
	"<tt>TextClockFreq</tt>" option), as many flat panels will need a
	dot clock different than the default to synchronise. The
	programmable clock makes this option obsolete and so it's use
	isn't recommended.
<tag>
Option &dquot;use_vclk1&dquot; (Chips 65550 and later)
</tag>
	The HiQV series of chips have three programmable clocks. The
	first two are usually loaded with 25.175 and 28.322MHz for
	VGA backward compatibility, and the third is used as a fully
	programmable clock. On at least one system (the Inside 686 LCD/S
	single board computer) the third clock is unusable. This option
	forces the use of VClk1 as the programmable clock.
<tag>
TextClockFreq 25.175
</tag>
	It is impossible for the server to read the value of the currently
	used frequency for the text console from the chip with the ct6554x
	series of chips. Therefore the server uses a default value of
	25.175MHz as the text console clock. For some LCDs, in particular
	DSTN screens, this clock will be wrong. This allows the user to
	select a different clock for the server to use when returning to
	the text console.
<tag>
Option &dquot;mmio&dquot;
</tag>
        This enables the use of memory-mapped I/O to talk to the BitBLT
        engine. By default memory-mapped I/O is not enabled on the
	6554x series of chips, and is only usable on 6554x's with PCI
	buses. This option has no effect when not using the BitBLT engine
	(e.g. when using "<tt>no_bitblt</tt>"), or for the 65550 which can
	only use MMIO for access to the BitBLT engine. On 65545 PCI
	machines MMIO is enabled by default because the blitter can not
	be used otherwise.
<tag>
Option &dquot;suspend_hack&dquot;
</tag>
	This option sets the centering and stretching to the bios
	default values. This can fix suspend/resume problems on some
	machines. It overrides the options &dquot;lcd_center&dquot; 
	and &dquot;no_stretch&dquot;.
<tag>
Option &dquot;use_18bit_bus&dquot;  (Chips 65540/45/46/48)
</tag>
	For 24bpp on TFT screens, the server assumes that a 24bit bus
	is being used. This can result in a reddish tint to 24bpp mode.
	This option, selects an 18 bit TFT bus. For other depths this
	option has no effect.
<tag>
Chipset &dquot;ct65546&dquot; (or some other chip)
</tag>
	It is possible that the chip could be misidentified, particular
	due to interactions with other drivers in the server. It is
	possible to force the server to identify a particular chip with
	this option.
<tag>
Option &dquot;sync_on_green&dquot; (Chips 65550/54)
</tag>
	Composite sync on green. Possibly useful if you wish to use an
	old workstation monitor. The 65550/54 internal RAMDAC's support
	this mode of operation, but whether a particular machine does
	depends on the manufacturer. 
<tag>
Option &dquot;fast_dram&dquot; (Chips 65550/54)
</tag>
	This option sets the internal memory clock (MCLK) register to
	another value. The default value programmed by the BIOS is
	usually OK, but some machines can accept a faster MClk to achieve
	a better performance. One machine known to work well with this
	option is the Toshiba 720CDT. This option is generally not
	recommended.
</descrip>

<sect> Modelines <p>

When constructing a modeline for use with the Chips and Technologies
driver you'll needed to considered several points

<descrip>
<tag> * Virtual Screen Size </tag>
		It is the virtual screen size that determines the amount
	of memory used by a mode. So if you have a virtual screen size
	set to 1024x768 using a 800x600 at 8bpp, you use 768kB for the
	mode. Further to this some of the XAA acceleration requires that
	the display pitch is a multiple of 64 pixels. So the driver will
	attempt to round-up the virtual X dimension to a multiple of 64,
	but leave the virtual resolution untouched. This might further
	reduce the available memory.
<tag> * 16/24 Bits Per Pixel </tag>
		Chips later than the ct65540 are capable of supporting
	Hi-Color and True-Color modes. These are implemented in the current
	server. The clocks in the 6554x series of chips are internally
	divided by 2 for 16bpp and 3 for 24bpp, allowing one modeline to
	be used at all depths.  The effect of this is that the maximum
	dot clock visible to the user is a half or a third of the value
	at 8bpp. The 6555x series of chips doesn't need to use additional
	clock cycles to display higher depths, and so the same modeline
	can be used at all depths, without needing to divide the clocks.
	Also 16/24 bpp modes will need 2 or 3 times respectively more video
	ram.
<tag> * Frame Acceleration</tag>
		Many DSTN screens use frame acceleration to improve the
	performance of the screen. This can be done by using an external
	frame buffer, or incorporating the framebuffer at the top of video
	ram depending on the particular implementation. The Xserver assumes
	that the framebuffer, if used, will be at the top of video ram.
	The amount of ram required for the framebuffer will vary depending
	on the size of the screen, and will reduce the amount of video
	ram available to the modes. Typical values for the size of the
	framebuffer will be 61440 bytes (640x480 panel), 96000 bytes
	(800x600 panel) and 157287 bytes (1024x768 panel).
<tag> * H/W Acceleration </tag>
		The H/W cursor will need 1kB for the 6554x and 4kb for the
	65550. On the 64300 chips the H/W cursors is stored in registers and
	so no allowance is needed for the H/W cursor. In addition to this
	many graphics operations are speeded up using a
	"<tt>pixmap cache</tt>". Leaving too little memory available for
	the cache will only have a detrimental effect on the graphics
	performance.
<tag> * VESA like modes </tag>
		We recommend that you try and pick a mode that is similar
	to a standard VESA mode. If you don't a suspend/resume or LCD/CRT
	switch might mess up the screen. This is a problem with the video
	BIOS not knowing about all the funny modes that might be selected.
<tag> * Dot Clock </tag>
		For LCD screens, the lowest clock that gives acceptable
	contrast and flicker is usually the best one. This also gives
	more memory bandwidth for use in the drawing operations. Some
	users prefer to use clocks that are defined by their BIOS. This
	has the advantage that the BIOS will probably restore the clock
	they specified after a suspend/resume or LCD/CRT switch.
</descrip>

The ct655xx driver is capable of driving both a CRT and a flat panel
display. In fact the timing for the flat panel are dependent on the
specification of the panel itself and are independent of the particular
mode chosen. For this reason it is recommended to use one of the programs
that automatically generate XF86Config files, such as "<tt>xf86config</tt>"
or "<tt>XF86Setup</tt>".

However there are many machines, particular those with 800x600 screen or
larger, that need to reprogram the panel timings. The reason for this is
that the manufacturer has used the panel timings to get a standard EGA
mode to work on flat panel, and these same timings don't work for an SVGA
mode. For these machines the "<tt>use_modeline</tt>" and/or possibly the
"<tt>fix_panel_size</tt>" option might be needed. Some machines that 
are known to need these options include.

<sect> Troubleshooting <p>

<descrip>
<tag> The cursor appears as a white box, after switching modes</tag>
	There is a known bug in the H/W cursor, that sometimes causes
	the cursor to be redrawn as a white box, when the mode is changed.
	This can be fixed by moving the cursor to a different region,
	switching to the console and back again, or if it is too annoying
	the H/W cursor can be disabled with the "<tt>sw_cursor</tt>" option.
<tag> The cursor hot-spot isn't at the same point as the cursor</tag>
 	With modes on the 6555x machines that are stretched to fill the
	flat panel, the H/W cursor is not correspondingly stretched. This
	is a small and long-standing bug in the current server. You can
	avoid this by either using the "<tt>no_stretch</tt>" or
	<tt>sw_cursor</tt>" options.
<tag> The lower part of the screen is corrupted</tag>
	Many DSTN screens use the top of video ram to implement a frame
	accelerator. This reduces the amount of video ram available to
	the modes. The server doesn't prevent the user from specifying
	a mode that will use this memory, it prints a warning on the console.
	The effect of this problem will be that the lower part of the screen
	will reside in the same memory as the frame accelerator and will
	therefore be corrupt. Try reducing the amount of memory consumed
	by the mode.
<tag> There is a video signal, but the screen doesn't sync.</tag>
        You are using a mode that your screen cannot handle. If it is a
        non-standard mode, maybe you need to tweak the timings a bit. If
        it is a standard mode and frequency that your screen should be
        able to handle, try to find different timings for a similar mode
        and frequency combination. For LCD modes, it is possible that your
	LCD panel requires different panel timings at the text console than
	with a graphics mode. In this case you will need the
	"<tt>use_modeline</tt>" and perhaps also the "<tt>fix_panel_size</tt>"
	options to reprogram the LCD panel timings to sensible values.
<tag> `Wavy' screen.</tag>
        Horizontal waving or jittering of the whole screen, continuously
        (independent from drawing operations).  You are probably using a
        dot clock that is too high (or too low); it is also possible that
	there is interference with a close MCLK. Try a lower dot clock.
	For CRT's you can also try to tweak the mode timings; try increasing
        the second horizontal value somewhat.
<tag> Crash or hang after start-up (probably with a black screen).</tag>
        Try the "<tt>noaccel</tt>" or "<tt>no_bitblt</tt>" options. Check
        that the BIOS settings are OK; in particular, disable caching of
        0xa0000-0xaffff. Disabling hidden DRAM refresh may also help.
<tag> Crash, hang, or trash on the screen after a graphics operation.</tag>
        This may be related to a bug in one of the accelerated
        functions, or a problem with the BitBLT engine. Try the
        "<tt>noaccel</tt>" or "<tt>no_bitblt</tt>" options. Also check the
	BIOS settings. It is also possible that with a high dot clock and
	depth on a large screen there is very little bandwidth left for using
	the BitBLT engine. Try reducing the clock.
<tag> Chipset is not detected.</tag>
        Try forcing the chipset to a type that is most similar to what
        you have.
<tag>The screen is blank when starting X</tag>
	One possible cause of this problem is if the kernel has been 
	compiled with the "APM_DISPLAY_BLANK" option. It appears that
	this option doesn't work as specified and can cause the Xserver
	to blank when starting X. In all cases the kernel should be compiled
	without this option. If the problem remains a CRT/LCD or switch to
	and from the virtual console will often fix it.
<tag> Textmode is not properly restored</tag>
        This has been reported on some configurations. Many laptops
	use the programmable clock of the 6554x chips at the console.
	It is not always possible to find out the setting that is
	used for this clock if BIOS has written the MClk after the
	VClk. Hence the server assumes a 25.175MHz clock at the
	console. This is correct for most modes, but can cause some
	problems. Usually this is fixed by switching between the LCD
	and CRT. Alternatively the user can use the "<tt>TextClockFreq</tt>"
	option described above to select a different clock for the
	text console. Another possible cause of this problem is if the kernel
	is compiled with the "APM_DISPLAY_BLANK" option. As mentioned
	before, this option should be disabled.
<tag> I can't display 640x480 on my 800x600 LCD</tag>
	The problem here is that the flat panel needs timings that
	are related to the panel size, and not the mode size. There is
	no facility in the current Xservers to specify these values,
	and so the server attempts to read the panel size from the
	chip. If the user has used the "<tt>use_modeline</tt>" or
	"<tt>fix_panel_size</tt>" options the panel timings are derived
	from the mode, which can be different than the panel size. Try
	deleting theses options	from XF86Config or using an LCD/CRT switch.
<tag> I can't get a 320x240 mode to occupy the whole 640x480 LCD</tag>
	There is a bug in the 6554x's H/W cursor for modes that are
	doubled vertically. The lower half of the screen is not accessible.
	The servers solution to this problem is not to do doubling vertically.
	Which results in the 320x240 mode only expanded to 640x360. If this
	is a problem, a work around is to use the "<tt>sw_cursor</tt>"
	option. The server will then allow the mode to occupy the whole
	640x480 LCD.
<tag> After a suspend/resume my screen is messed up</tag>
	During a suspend/resume, the BIOS controls what is read and 
	written back to the registers. If the screen is using a mode
	that BIOS doesn't know about, then there is no guarantee that
	it will be resumed correctly. For this reason a mode that is
	as close to VESA like as possible should be selected. It is also
	possible that the VGA palette can be affected by a suspend/resume.
	Using an 8bpp, the colour will then be displayed incorrectly. This
	shouldn't affect higher depths, and is fixable with a switch to
	the virtual console and back.
<tag> The right hand edge of the mode isn't visible on the LCD</tag>
	This is usually due to a problem with the "<tt>lcd-center</tt>"
	option. If this option is removed form XF86Config, then the problem
	might go away. Alternatively the manufacturer could have incorrectly
	programmed the panel size in the EGA console mode. The
	"<tt>fix_panel_size</tt>" can be used to force the modeline values into
	the panel size registers. Two machines that are known to have this
	problem are the "<tt>HP OmniBook 5000</tt>" and the "<tt>NEC  Versa
	4080</tt>".
<tag> My TFT screen has a reddish tint in 24bpp mode</tag>
	The server assumes that the TFT bus width is 24bits. If this is not
	true then the screen will appear to have a reddish tint. This can
	be fixed by using the "<tt>use_18bit_bus</tt>" option. Note that
	the reverse is also true. If the "<tt>use_18bit_bus</tt>" is used
	and the TFT bus width is 24bpp, then the screen will appear reddish.
	Note that this option only has an effect on TFT screens. 
<tag> I can't start X-windows with 16 or 24bpp</tag>
	Firstly, is your machine capable of 16/24bpp with the mode
	specified. Many LCD displays are incapable of using a 24bpp 
	mode. Also you need at least a 65540 to use 16/24bpp, and the
	amount of memory used by the mode will be doubled/tripled. The
	correct options to start the server with these modes are
<verb>
	  startx -- -bpp 16               5-6-5 RGB ('64K color', XGA)
	  startx -- -bpp 16 -weight 555   5-5-5 RGB ('Hicolor')
	  startx -- -bpp 24               8-8-8 RGB truecolor
</verb>
	Note that there is currently no "<tt>-bpp 32</tt>" mode in the Xserver,
	although the 65550 is capable of this.

  A general problem with the server that can manifested in many way such
  as drawing errors, wavy screens, etc is related to the programmable
  clock. Many potential programmable clock register setting are unstable.
  However luckily there are many different clock register setting that
  can give the same or very similar clocks. The clock code can be fooled
  into giving a different and perhaps more stable clock by simply changing
  the clock value slightly. For example 65.00MHz might be unstable while
  65.10MHz is not. So for unexplained problems not addressed above, please
  try to alter the clock you are using slightly, say in steps of 0.05MHz
  and see if the problem goes away.

  For other screen drawing related problems, try the "<tt>noaccel</tt>" or
  "<tt>no_bitblt</tt>" options. A useful trick for all laptop computers is to
  switch between LCD/CRT (usually with something like Fn-F5), if the
  screen is having problems.

  If you are having driver-related problems that are not addressed by this
  document, or if you have found bugs in accelerated functions, you can
  try contacting the XFree86 team (the current driver maintainer can be
  reached at <it>dbateman@eng.uts.edu.au</it> or
