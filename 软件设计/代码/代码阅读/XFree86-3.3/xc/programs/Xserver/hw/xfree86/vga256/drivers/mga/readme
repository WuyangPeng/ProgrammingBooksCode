MGA Millennium (MGA2064W) with TVP3026 RAMDAC Driver v1.2
=========================================================
MGA Mystique (MGA1064W) with integrated RAMDAC Driver v1.2
=========================================================

NOTE: This driver is fairly new, and not everything works like you expect
it to. It shouldn't crash your machine, and there are problems with 24 bpp,
but it should work pretty well. Please report any and all problems to
XFree86@Xfree86.org using the appropriate bug report sheet. 

This is the first release of Mystique driver and, for this board, acceleration
functions might not work. 


Features:
---------

* Fairly complete support for the Matrox Millennium video adapter.
* First release of support for Matrox Mystique
* Can only use a linear frame buffer
* It should be possible to reach resolutions up to 1920x1024.
* It should be possible to use pixel depths of:
   -  8 bits per pixel (256 pseudo colour)
   - 16 bits per pixel (high colour)
   - 24 bits per pixel (packed true colour) **
   - 32 bits per pixel (true colour)

There are some 24 bpp mode problems - tiling doesn't work properly, so for some 
programs, notably Netscape, gimp, xsetroot, etc, you may see corrupted images.


Planned Features
----------------

In order from highest to lowest priority:

* More hardware acceleration.
* Support for more chipsets and RAMDACs.
* 3D acceleration
* other depths (16,24,32 bits) and acceleration features for Mystique board

Technical Notes:

Hardware Supported:
-------------------

This driver supports the Matrox Storm (MGA2064W) chipset with the
Texas Instruments TVP3026 RAMDAC  and (MGA1064SG). Matrox has so far only shipped boards with:
- for Millenium board:
- - - - - - - - - - - 
175 MHz, 220 MHz and 250 MHz components. We are looking at 3030 support 
(the Genesis), so hang in there.

- for Mystique board:
- - - - - - - - - - -
up to 170 MHz,

This driver auto-detects the amount of installed WRAM and the RAMDAC speed,
so you don't need to probe or specify these. Same goes for the clocks, which
are fully progrmamable on the RAMDAC. The driver takes care of everything
for you!

Support for other Matrox cards is planned, pending the receipt of documentation
from Matrox.

Configuration:
--------------

The driver auto-detects all device info included memory size, so use the following device
section in your XF86Config file:

- for Millenium board:
----------------------
	Section "Device"
		Identifier	"Matrox Millennium"
		VendorName	"Matrox"
		BoardName	"Millennium"
	EndSection

- for Mystique board:
- - - - - - - - - - -
	Section "Device"
    		Identifier  "Mystique"
    		VendorName  "Matrox"
    		BoardName   "mga1064sg"
	EndSection

or let xf86config or XF86Setup do this for you.

But if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

    VideoRam  - in kilobytes
    DacSpeed  - in MHz
    MemBase   - physical address of the linear framebuffer 
    IoBase    - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers
    BiosBase  - physical address of BIOS


Driver Options:
---------------

"noaccel"	- turns off Drawing Engine (mandatory for Mystique)
"sw_cursor"     - turns hardware cursor off
"xaa_benchmark" - do some benchmarks during startup

- for Mystique board:
- - - - - - - - - - -
Interleaved features are not available
 
Memory Clock Hack
-----------------

- for Millenium board:
- - - - - - - - - - - 

It seems some Millenniums have a BIOS that defines the memory clock
for 2 MB and 4 MB cards to be 50 MHz, while others define it to be
60 MHz. Using the faster clock speeds up drawing operations a good
amount, so a hack has been put in place to set MCLK from XF86Config.

In the file mga_dac3026.c, simply change the following line:
   #define MCLK_FROM_XCONFIG 0
to this:
   #define MCLK_FROM_XCONFIG 1

and specify in XF86Config:

    Set_Mclk  - in MHz

USE THIS HACK ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!!!

Using memory clocks from 40 to 50 MHz should be completely safe. Setting
the memory clock higher than 50 MHz, up to 65 MHz has been tested, and
seems to work. DO NOT EXCEED 65 MHz, or the video memory contents will
become corrupted and you may damage the card!

- for Mystique board:
- - - - - - - - - - -
MCLK_FROM_XCONFIG flag has no effect.
