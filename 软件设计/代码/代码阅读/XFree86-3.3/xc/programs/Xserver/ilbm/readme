   ilbm -- Interleaved bitplanes for Amiga
           © Copyright 1995 by Geert Uytterhoeven and Others (read the sources)

All stuff in this directory is based on Xdaniver, which is based on mfb (read
../afb/Xdaniver.doc).

I made changes to support the interleaved mode of the Linux/68k Amiga Color
Frame Buffer Device, which uses interleaved bitplanes instead of normal
bitplanes.

Note: there are still some annoying bugs left in ilbmimage.
