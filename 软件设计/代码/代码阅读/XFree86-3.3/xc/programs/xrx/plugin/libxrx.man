.SH NAME
libxrx - RX Netscape Navigator Plug-in
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBRX Plug-in\fP may be used with Netscape Navigator (3.0 or later) to
interpret documents in the RX MIME type format and start remote
applications.
.PP
The \fBRX Plug-in\fP reads an RX document, from which it gets the list
of services the application wants to use. Based on this information, the
\fBRX Plug-in\fP sets the various requested services, including creating
authorization keys if your X server supports the SECURITY extension. It
then passes the relevant data, such as the X display name, to the
application through an HTTP GET request of the associated CGI script. The
Web server then executes the CGI script to start the application. The
client runs on the web server host connected to your X server. In
addition when the RX document is used within the EMBED tag (a Netscape
extension to HTML), the \fBRX Plug-in\fP uses the XC-APPGROUP extension, if
it is supported by your X server, to cause the remote application to be
embedded within the browser page from which it was launched.
.PP
.SH INSTALLATION
To install the \fBRX Plug-in\fP so that Netscape Navigator can use it, find
the file named libxrx.so.6.3 or libxrx.sl.6.3 (or similar, depending on
your platform) in <ProjectRoot>/lib (e.g. /usr/X11R6.3/lib) and copy it to
either /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins or $HOME/.netscape/plugins. Do
not install the symlinks libxrx.so or libxrx.sl; they would confuse
Netscape.
.PP
If you have configured Netscape Navigator to use the RX helper program
(\fBxrx\fP), you must reconfigure it. Generally you simply need to remove
or comment out the line you may have previously added in your mailcap file
to use the RX helper program.
Otherwise the plug-in will not be enabled. (The usual comment character for
mailcap is ``#''.)
.PP
If you are already running Netscape Navigator, you need to exit and restart
it after copying the plug-in library so the new plug-in will be found.
Once this is done you can check that Navigator has successfully loaded the
plug-in by checking the ``About Plug-ins'' page from the Help menu. This
should show something like:

                            RX Plug-in

    File name: /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins/libxrx.sl.6.3

    X Remote Activation Plug-in

    Mime Type         Description                  Suffixes  Enabled
    application/x-rx  X Remote Activation Plug-in  xrx       Yes

.PP
Once correctly configured, Netscape Navigator will activate the \fBRX
Plug-in\fP whenever you retrieve any document of the MIME type
\fIapplication/x-rx\fP.
.PP
.SH RESOURCES
The \fBRX Plug-in\fP looks for resources associated with the widget
\fBnetscape.Navigator (\fPclass\fB Netscape.TopLevelShell)\fP and
understands the following resource names and classes:
.\".in +1in
.TP 8
.B "xrxHasFirewallProxy (\fPclass\fB XrxHasFirewallProxy)"
Specifies whether an X server firewall proxy (see xfwp) is running and
should be used. Default is ``False.''
.TP 8
.B "xrxInternalWebServers (\fPclass\fB XrxInternalWebServers)"
The web servers for which the X server firewall proxy should not be used
(only relevant when \fBxrxHasFirewallProxy\fP is ``True''). Its value is a
comma separated list of mask/value pairs to be used to filter internal
web servers, based on their address. The mask part specifies which segments
of the address are to be considered and the value part specifies what the
result should match. For instance the following list:

      255.255.255.0/198.112.45.0, 255.255.255.0/198.112.46.0

matches the address sets: 198.112.45.* and 198.112.46.*. More precisely,
the test is (address & mask) == value.
.TP 8
.B "xrxFastWebServers (\fPclass\fB XrxFastWebServers)"
The web servers for which LBX should not be used. The resource value is a
list of address mask/value pairs, as previously described.
.TP 8
.B "xrxTrustedWebServers (\fPclass\fB XrxTrustedWebServers)"
The web servers from which remote applications should be run as trusted
clients. The default is to run remote applications as untrusted
clients. The resource value is a list of address mask/value pairs, as
previously described.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If the RX document requests X-UI-LBX service and the default X server does
not advertise the LBX extension, the \fIRX Plug-in\fP will look for the
environment variable ``XREALDISPLAY'' to get a second address for your X
server and look for the LBX extension there. When running your browser
through \fIlbxproxy\fP you will need to set XREALDISPLAY to the actual
address of your server if you wish remote applications to be able to use
LBX across the Internet.
.PP
If the RX document requests XPRINT service, \fIRX Plug-in\fP looks for the
variable ``XPRINTER'' to get the printer name and X Print server address to
use. If the server address is not specified as part of XPRINTER, \fIRX
Plug-in\fP uses the first one specified through the variable
``XPSERVERLIST'' when it is set. When it is not \fIRX Plug-in\fP then tries
to use the video server as the print server. If the printer name is not
specified via XPRINTER, \fIRX Plug-in\fP looks for it in the variables
``PDPRINTER'', then ``LPDEST'', and finally ``PRINTER'',
.PP
Finally, if you are using a firewall proxy, \fIRX Plug-in\fP will look for
``PROXY_MANAGER'' to get the address of your proxy manager (see
proxymngr). When not specified it will use ":6500" as the default.
.PP
.SH KNOWN BUG
When an authorization key is created for a remote application to use the X
Print service, the \fBRX Plug-in\fP has to create the key with an infinite
timeout since nobody knows when the application will actually connect to
the X Print server. It then revokes the key when its instance is destroyed
(that is when you go to another page). However, if the Plug-in does not get
destroyed properly, which happens when Netscape Navigator dies
unexpectedly, the print authorization key will never get revoked.
