/* Even though we want to build the distribution with -n32, Navigator 3.0
 * binaries are still built on IRIX 5.2, which means we need to use the
 * old style object format. This is a hack because this Imakefile gets
 * included too late to do this properly, that is to say that the
 * CCOPTIONS in Imake.tmpl gets the -n32 options that we don't want,
 * but the CCOPTIONS in Library.tmpl does get set correctly, and over-
 * rides the value. So it works, but it's not pretty.
