This directory contains the DCS3 Draft Consortium Standard for the 
PEX 5.2 library specification.
    
The Draft Consortium Standard specification is considered to be a
viable and complete specification.  However, it is not an official
X Consortium standard because the proof of concept implementation
requirement has not yet been fulfilled.  This specification will
remain in Draft Consortium Standard status until the proof of
concept criteria has been met.
