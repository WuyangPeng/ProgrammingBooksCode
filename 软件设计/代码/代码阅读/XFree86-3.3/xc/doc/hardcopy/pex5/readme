This directory contains subdirectories for two different revisions of 
the PEX and PEXlib specifications.  

PEX5.1 contains the PEX and PEXlib version 5.1 specifications, which
are official X Consortium Standards.

PEX5.2 contains the PEX and PEXlib version 5.2 specifications, which
are Draft Consortium Standards.  The Draft Consortium Standards are 
considered to be viable and complete specifications.  However, they are 
not official X Consortium standards because the proof of concept 
implementation requirement has not yet been fulfilled.  The PEX 5.2 
specifications will remain in Draft Consortium Standard status until 
the proof of concept criteria have been met.
