</A><A HREF="lbxTOC.html">..</A><HR></H1>

       Low Bandwidth X (LBX) is a network-transparent protocol for running X Window System applications 
       over transport channels whose bandwidth and latency are significantly worse than that used in local area net
       works. It combines a variety of caching and reencoding techniques to reduce the volume of data that must be 
       sent over the wire. It can be used with existing clients by placing a proxy between the clients and server, so 
       that the low bandwidth/high latency communication occurs between the proxy and server.
<P>

       This extension was designed and implemented by Jim Fulton, David Lemke, Keith Packard, and Dale 
       Tonogai, all of Network Computing Devices (NCD). Chris Kent Kantarjiev (Xerox PARC) participated in 
       early design discussions. Ralph Mor (X Consortium) designed and implemented additional sections. Donna 
       Converse (X Consortium) authored the protocol description and encoding from design notes and the imple
       mentation. Ray Tice (X Consortium) resolved the open issues in the design and specification. Bob Scheifler 
       (X Consortium) helped out in many areas.
<P>

       The extension name is "LBX".
<P>

<H1><A NAME="MMM2">2      Description
</A><A HREF="lbxTOC.html">..</A><HR></H1>

       The design center for LBX is to use a proxy as an intermediary between the client and server. The proxy 
       reencodes and compresses requests, events, replies and errors, as well as the resulting data stream. Addition
       ally, the proxy can cache information from the server to provide low-latency replies to clients. This reply 
       generation by the proxy is known as short-circuiting. A proxy can handle multiple clients for a given server, 
       but does not prevent clients from connecting directly to the server. The design allows the proxy to multiplex 
       multiple clients into a single data stream to the server.
<P>

       Much of LBX is implemented as an extension. The compression and reencoding changes can be isolated to 
       the transport and dispatch portions of the server, while short-circuiting requires minor changes to the 
       server's colormap and property code.
<P>

       LBX employs several different compression and short-circuiting methods. Use of these methods is negotia
       ble, and in some cases, the algorithm used by a given method is negotiable as well. LBX also provides for 
       negotiation of extensions to LBX.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM3">2.1    Data Flow
</A></H2>

       The LBX data stream goes through a number of layers:
<P>

       0.     Client requests
<P>
       1.     Read by LBX and potential byte-swapping
<P>
       2.     Request-specific compression
<P>
       3.     Potential byte swapping
<P>
       4.     Multiplexing of client request streams
<P>
       5.     Delta replacement
<P>
       6.     Stream compression
<P>
       Transport
<P>

       6.     Stream decompression
<P>
       5.     Delta substitution
<P>
       4.     Demultiplexing of client request streams
<P>
       3.     Potential byte swapping
<P>
       2.     Reencoding
<P>
       1.     Request processing
<P>
       The reverse process occurs with X server replies, events, and errors.
<P>

<H2>2.2    <A NAME="11018">Tags</A>
</H2>

       Tags are used to support caching of large data items that are expected to be queried multiple times. Such 
       things as the keyboard map and font metrics are often requested by multiple clients. Rather than send the 
       data each time, the first time the data is sent it includes a tag. The proxy saves this data, so that subsequent 
       requests can send only the tag to refer to that same data. The different types of tags are used for connection 
       information, keyboard maps, modifier maps, fonts information and properties.
<P>

       Tag usage is negotiated as a boolean in the LbxStartProxy message. The proxy controls how many tags 
       are stored in the proxy. The server may wish to observe the proxy's InvalidateTag behavior to limit how 
       many tags are cached at any one time. Tagged data is not shared across types of tags, but the number space 
       used for the tag ids is. The tag ids are generated by the server.
<P>

       The X server keeps track of what tags are known to the proxy. The proxy can invalidate a tag if no tag bear
       ing replies of that type are pending. The proxy sends an LbxInvalidateTag message to release the 
       tagged data. The proxy must not invalidate connection tags unless instructed to do so by the server. 
<P>

       If the server wishes to discard tagged data, it must either have received an LbxInvalidateTag request 
       from the proxy or send an LbxInvalidateTag event to the proxy for that tag. 
<P>

<H3>2.2.1     <A NAME="26534">Tag Substitution in Requests</A>
</H3>

       Many substitution requests have a tag field, followed by fields marked optional. For these requests, if the 
       optional fields are present, the data in them is stored in the indicated tag, unless the tag is 0. If the optional 
       fields are absent, the tag field indicates the tag that contains the data for the "optional" fields.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="MMM4">2.2.2     Property Tags
</A></H3>

       Property data makes special use of tags. A common use of properties is for inter-client communication. If 
       both clients use the proxy, it is wasteful to send the data to the server and then back, when the server may 
       never need it. LbxChangeProperty request does the same work as the core ChangeProperty 
       request, but it does not send the data. The reply to this request contains a tag id corresponding to the data. If 
       the property information is used locally, the server responds to LbxGetProperty with the tag, and the 
       property data need never be sent to the server. If the server does require the data, it can issue an LbxQue
       ryTag message. The proxy can also send the data on at any time if it judges it appropriate (i.e., when the 
       wire goes idle). Since the proxy owns the property data, it must not invalidate the tag before sending the data 
       back to the server via an LbxTagData request.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM5">2.3    Short-circuiting
</A></H2>

       Short-circuiting is used to handle constant data. This includes atoms, color name/RGB mappings, and 
       AllocColor calls. Atoms and color name/RGB mappings stay constant for the life of the server. Alloc
       Color replies are constant for each colormap. Short-circuiting replaces round-trip requests with one-way 
       requests, and can sometimes use one in place of many.
<P>

       Atoms are used heavily for ICCCM communication. Once the proxy knows the string to atom mapping, it 
       has no need to send subsequent requests for this atom to the server.
<P>

       Colorname/RGB mappings are constant, so once the proxy sees the response from LookupColor, it need 
       not forward any subsequent requests.
<P>

       Clients often use the same color cells, so once a read-only color allocation has occurred, the proxy knows 
       what RGB values should be returned to the client. The proxy doesn't need to forward any AllocColor 
       requests it can resolve, but it must tell the server to modify the color cell's reference count. LbxIncre
       mentPixel is used to support this.
<P>

       For all three classes of short-circuiting, the proxy must still tell the server a request has occurred, so that the 
       request sequence numbers stay in sync. This is done with LbxModifySequence.
<P>

       Sequence numbers cause the major complication with short-circuiting. X guarantees that any replies, events 
       or errors generated by a previous request will be sent before those of a later request. This means that any 
       requests that can be handled by the proxy must have their reply sent after any previous events or errors. 
<P>

       If a proxy's applications do not require strict adherence to the X protocol ordering of errors or events, a 
       proxy might provide further optimization by avoiding the overhead of maintaining this ordering, however, 
       the resulting protocol is not strictly X11 compliant.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM6">2.4    Graphics Re-encoding
</A></H2>

       The LBX proxy attempts to reencode PolyPoint, PolyLine, PolySegment, PolyRectangle, 
       PolyArc, FillPoly, PolyFillRectangle, PolyFillArc, CopyArea, CopyPlane, 
       PolyText8, PolyText16, ImageText8, and ImageText16 requests. If the request can be reen
       coded, it may be replaced by an equivalent LBX form of the request. The requests are reencoded by attempt
       ing to reduce 2-byte coordinate, length, width and angle fields to 1 byte. Where applicable, the coordinate 
       mode is also converted to Previous to improve the compressibility of the resulting data. In image 
       requests, the image data may also be compressed.
<P>

<H2>2.5    <A NAME="15503">Motion events</A>
</H2>

       To prevent clogging the wire with MotionNotify events, the server and proxy work together to control 
       the number of events on the wire. This is done with the LbxAllowMotion request. The request adds an 
       amount to an allowed motion count in the server, which is kept on a per-proxy basis. Every motion notify 
       event sent to the proxy decrements the allowed motion counter. If the allowed motion count is less than or 
       equal to zero, motion events not required by the X protocol definition are not sent to the proxy. The allowed 
       motion counter has a minimum value of -2^31.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM7">2.6    Event Squishing
</A></H2>

       In the core protocol, all events are padded as needed to be 32 bytes long. The LBX extension reduces traffic 
       by removing padding at the end of events, and implying the event length from its type. This is known as 
       squishing.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM8">2.7    Master Client 
</A></H2>

       When the initial X connection between the proxy and the server is converted to LBX mode, the proxy itself 
       becomes the master client. New client requests and some tag messages are sent in the context of the master 
       client.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM9">2.8    Multiplexing of Clients
</A></H2>

       The LBX proxy multiplexes the data streams of all its clients into one stream, and then splits them apart 
       again when they are received. The LbxSwitch message is used to tell each end which client is using the 
       wire at the time.
<P>

       The server should process delta requests in the order that they appear on the LBX connection. If the server 
       does not maintain the interclient request order for requests sent by the proxy, it must still obey the semantics 
       implied by the interclient request order so that the delta cache functions correctly.
<P>

       The server can affect the multiplexing of clients by the proxy using the LbxListenToOne and LbxLis
       tenToAll messages. This is useful during grabs, since the master connection can not be blocked during 
       grabs like other clients. The proxy is responsible for tracking server grabs issued by its clients so that the 
       proxy can multiplex the client streams in an order executable by the server. 
<P>

       Replies must be ordered in the multiplexed data stream from the server to the proxy such that the reply car
       rying tagged data precedes replies that refer to that tagged data.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM10">2.9    Swapping
</A></H2>

       Swapping is handled as with any X extension, with one caveat. Since a proxy can be supporting clients with 
       different byte orders, and they all share the same wire, the length fields of all messages between the server 
       and proxy are expressed in the proxy byte order. This prevents any problems with length computation that 
       may occur when clients are switched.
<P>

<H2>2.10   <A NAME="22595">Delta cache</A>
</H2>

       LBX takes advantage of the fact that an X message may be very similar to one that has been previously sent. 
       For example, a KeyPress event may differ from a previous KeyPress event in just a few bytes. By send
       ing just the bytes that differ (or "deltas"), the number of bytes sent over the wire can be substantially 
       reduced. Delta compaction is used on requests being sent by the proxy as well as on replies and events being 
       sent by the server.
<P>

       The server and the proxy each keep per-proxy request and response caches. The response cache contains 
       events, errors and replies. All messages are saved in the appropriate delta cache if they are of an appropriate 
       type and more than 8 bytes long but fit within the delta cache. The number of entries in the delta cache and 
       the maximum saved message size are negotiated in the LbxStartProxy request. 
<P>

       The LBX requests that are never stored in the request delta cache are the LbxQueryVersion, Lbx
       StartProxy, LbxSwitch, LbxNewClient, LbxAllowMotion, LbxDelta, LbxQueryExten
       sion, LbxPutImage, LbxGetImage, LbxBeginLargeRequest, LbxLargeRequestData, 
       LbxEndLargeRequest and LbxInternAtoms requests. The responses that are never stored in the 
       response cache are LbxSwitchEvent and LbxDeltaResponse. The message carried by a delta 
       message is also cached, if it meets the other requirements. Messages after the LbxStartProxy request are 
       cached starting at index 0, and incrementing the index, modulo the number of entries, thereafter. The request 
       and response caches are independently indexed.
<P>

       If the current message is cachable and the same length as a message in the corresponding delta cache, a delta 
       message may be substituted in place of the original message in the protocol stream. 
<P>

<H2>2.11   Stream <A NAME="11596">Compression</A>
</H2>

       Before being passed down to the transport layer messages can be passed through a general purpose data 
       compressor. The choice of compression algorithm is negotiated with <A HREF="#20870">"LbxStartProxy" on page 9</A>. The proxy 
       and server are not required to support any specific stream compressor. As an example, however, the X Con
       sortium implementation of a ZLIB based compressor is described below.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>                 The XC-ZLIB compressor is presented with a simple byte stream - the X and 
                 LBX message boundaries are not apparent. The data is broken up into fixed sized 
                 blocks. Each block is compressed using zlib 1.0 (by Gailly &amp; Adler), then a two 
                 byte header is prepended, and then the entire packet is transmitted. The header 
                 has the following information:
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>                  out[0] = (length &amp; 0xfff) &gt;&gt; 8 | ((compflag) ? 0x80 : 0);
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>                  out[1] = length &amp; 0xff;
</BLOCKQUOTE><H2><A NAME="MMM11">2.12   Authentication Protocols
</A></H2>

       The current version of LBX does not support multipass authentication protocols for clients of the proxy. 
       These authentication protocols return an Authenticate message in response to a connection setup 
       request, and require additional authentication data from the client after the LbxNewClient request, and 
       before the reply to LbxNewClient. One example of such a protocol is XC-QUERY-SECURITY-1. 
<P>

<H1>3      <A NAME="33319">C Library Interfaces </A>
<A HREF="lbxTOC.html">..</A><HR></H1>

       The C Library routines for LBX are in the Xext library. The prototypes are located in a file named "XLbx.h". 
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM12">3.1    Application Library Interfaces
</A></H2>

       In a proxy environment, applications do not need to call these routines to take advantage of LBX. Clients 
       can, however, obtain information about the LBX extension to the server using this interface. Use of this rou
       tine may be altered when connected through a proxy, as described in <A HREF="#33319">"C Library Interfaces" on page 5</A>.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="MMM13">3.1.1     XLbxQueryVersion
</A></H3>

       To determine the version of LBX supported by the X server, call XLbxQueryVersion.
<P>

<PRE>       Bool XLbxQueryVersion(display, major_version_return, minor_version_return)
          Display * display;
          int * major_version_return;
          int * minor_version_return;
       display                     Specifies the connection to the X server.
       major_version_return        Returns the extension major version number.
       minor_version_return        Returns the extension minor version number.
</PRE>

       The XLbxQueryVersion function determines if the LBX extension is present. If the extension is not 
       present, XLbxQueryVersion returns False; otherwise, it returns True. If the extension is present, 
       XLbxQueryVersion returns the major and minor version numbers of the extension as supported by the X 
       server.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="MMM14">3.2    Proxy Library Interfaces

       The following interfaces are intended for use by the proxy.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="MMM15">3.2.1     XLbxQueryExtension
</A></H3>

         To determine the dynamically assigned codes for the extension, use the Xlib function XQueryExtension 
       or the LBX function XLbxQueryExtension.
<P>

<PRE>       Bool XLbxQueryExtension(display, major_opcode_return, first_event_return, first_error_return)
          Display * display;       Specifies the connection to the X server.
          int * major_opcode_return; Returns the major opcode.
          int * first_event_return; Returns the first event code.
          int * first_error_return; Returns the first error code.
</PRE>

       The XLbxQueryExtension function determines if the LBX extension is present. If the extension is not 
       present, XLbxQueryExtension returns False; otherwise, it returns True. If the extension is present, 
       XLbxQueryExtension returns the major opcode for the extension to major_opcode_return, the base 
       event type code to first_event_return, and the base error code to first_error_return; otherwise, the return val
       ues are undefined.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="MMM16">3.2.2     XLbxGetEventBase
</A></H3>

         To determine the base event type code, use the Xlib function XQueryExtension or the LBX function 
       XLbxGetEventBase.
<P>

<PRE>       int XLbxGetEventBase(display)
          Display * display;       Specifies the connection to the X server.
</PRE>

       The XLbxGetEventBase function returns the base event type code if the extension is present; otherwise, 
       it returns -1.

       As with the X11 protocol, when a request terminates with an error, the request has no side effects (that is, 
       there is no partial execution).
<P>

       There is one error, LbxClient. This error indicates that the client field of an LBX request was invalid, or 
       that the proxy's connection was in an invalid state for a start or stop proxy request.

<P>

       There is one request that is expected to be used by the client or the proxy: LbxQueryExtension.
<P>

       The following requests are expected to be used only by the proxy, and are instigated by the proxy: Lbx
       StartProxy, LbxStopProxy, LbxNewClient, LbxSwitch, LbxCloseClient, LbxModify
       Sequence, LbxAllowMotion, LbxInvalidateTag, LbxTagData and LbxQueryTag.

       This request is identical to the QueryExtension request, with an additional field, and two optional addi
       tional fields. When the client issues an QueryExtension request, the proxy will substitute an LbxQue
       ryExtension request.
<P>

       This request determines if the named extension is present. If so, the major opcode for the extension is 
       returned, if it has one. Otherwise, zero is returned. Any minor opcode and the request formats are specific to 
       the extension. If the extension involves additional event types, the base event type code is returned. Other
       wise, zero is returned. The format of events is specific to the extension. If the extension involves additional 
       error codes, the base error code is returned. Otherwise, zero is returned. The format of additional data in the 
       errors is specific to the extension.
<P>

       In addition, the number of requests defined by the named extension is returned. If the number of requests is 
       nonzero, and if the information is available, reply-mask and event-mask will be included in the reply. The 
       reply-mask represents a bit-wise one-to-one correspondence with the extension requests. The least signifi
       cant bit corresponds to the first request, and the next bit corresponds to the next request, and so on. Each ele
       ment in the list contains eight meaningful bits, except for the last element, which contains eight or fewer 
       meaningful bits. Unused bits are not guaranteed to be zero. The bit corresponding to a request is set if the 
       request could generate a reply, otherwise it is zero. In the same way, the event-mask represents a bit-wise 
       one-to-one correspondence with the extension requests. A bit is set if the corresponding request could result 
       in the generation of one or more extension or X11 events. If reply-mask is present in the reply, event-mask 
       will also be present.

       This request negotiates LBX protocol options, and switches the proxy-server connection from X11 protocol 
       to LBX protocol.
<P>

       The proxy gives the preferred protocol options in the request. The server chooses from the given options and 
       informs the proxy which to use. The options may be listed in any order, and the proxy may choose which 
       options to negotiate. If an option is not successfully negotiated, the default is used.
<P>

       The server delta cache and proxy delta caches can be configured for number of entries, and the length of 
       entries. (See <A HREF="#22595">"Delta cache" on page 4</A> for details.) The delta caches are configured using the delta-server and 
       delta-proxy options. To configure a cache, the proxy sends the minimum, maximum and preferred values for 
       the number of cache entries, (minN, maxN, prefN), and the length of the cache entries, (minMaxMsgLen, 
       maxMaxMsgLen, prefMaxMsgLen). The server's reply fields, entries and maxlen, contains the values to use. 
       These values must be within the ranges specified by the proxy. The server may also specify an entries value 
       of 0 to disable delta caching. The cache entry lengths are specified in units of 4 bytes.
<P>

       The stream compression algorithm is selected using the stream-comp option. (Stream compression is 
       described in <A HREF="#11596">"Stream Compression" on page 5</A>.) Each algorithm has a name that follows the naming conven
       tions in <A HREF="#13570">"Algorithm Naming" on page 29</A>. To negotiate using the stream-comp option, the proxy lists its 
       available compressors. For each candidate algorithm, the proxy sends the name in the name field, and uses 
       the detail field to send any additional data specific to each compression algorithm. The reply contains a 0-
       based index into the list of algorithms to indicate which algorithm to use, followed by data specific to that 
       algorithm. 
<P>

       Bitmap compression is negotiated using the bitmap-comp option. The proxy sends a list of names of avail
       able algorithms, and the server reply lists the algorithms to use. For each bitmap algorithm in the reply, a 0-
       based index into the list of algorithms indicates the algorithm, and the opcode field gives the value for use in 
       requests. The algorithm names follow the conventions in <A HREF="#13570">"Algorithm Naming" on page 29</A>.
<P>

       Pixmap compression is negotiated using the pixmap-comp option. The proxy sends a list of available algo
       rithms. For each algorithm, the list includes, the name, a bitmask of supported formats, and a list of depths 
       that the format supports. The server reply lists the algorithms to use. For each pixmap algorithm in the reply, 
       the reply contains a 0-based index into the list of proxy algorithms, the opcode to use in requests when refer
       ring to this algorithm, a mask of valid formats, and a list of valid depths. Algorithm names follow the con
       ventions in <A HREF="#13570">"Algorithm Naming" on page 29</A>. 
<P>

       Squishing is negotiated using the use-squish option. If the proxy desires squishing, it sends a true value. The 
       reply from the server indicates whether to do squishing, and will indicate squishing only if use-squish is set 
       to true in the request. 
<P>

       Tag caching, described in <A HREF="#11018">"Tags" on page 2</A>, is negotiated using the use-tag option. If the proxy desires tag 
       caching, it sends a true value. The reply from the server indicates whether to do tag caching, and will 
       demand caching only if use-tag is set to true in the request.
<P>

       The colormap option is used to negotiate what color matching algorithm will be used by the proxy when the 
       proxy uses the LbxAllocColor request to allocate pixels in a grabbed colormap. To negotiate using the 
       colormap option, the proxy lists the names of available colormap algorithms. The choice in the reply con
       tains a 0-based index into the list of algorithms to indicate which algorithm to use, followed by data specific 
       to that algorithm. If no colormap algorithm is successfully negotiated, then the LbxAllocColor, 
       LbxGrabCmap, and LbxReleaseCmap requests will not be used.
<P>

       The extension option is used to control extensions to LBX. These extensions may, for example, enable other 
       types of compression. To negotiate an extension, the name of the extension is sent, followed by any data spe
       cific to that extension. The extension name follows the conventions in <A HREF="#13570">"Algorithm Naming" on page 29</A>. The 
       extension option may occur multiple times in the start proxy message, since multiple extensions can be 
       negotiated. The reply to an extension option contains the zero-based index of the extension option, as 
       counted in the LbxStartProxy message. This index is followed by extension-specific information. The 
       server does not respond to extensions it does not recognize.
<P>

       An LbxClient error is returned when a client which is already communicating through an LBX proxy to 
       the X server sends a LbxStartProxy request.

<P>

       This request, which is sent by the proxy over the control connection, creates a new virtual connection to the 
       server.
<P>

       Much of the information in the LbxNewClient request and reply is identical to the connection setup and 
       reply information in the core X protocol.
<P>

       For the LbxNewClient request, the field unique to LBX is client-id. For the LbxNewClient reply, tag-
       id and change-type are fields unique to LBX, and the contents of connection-data may be different in LBX 
       from the core X protocol (see below).
<P>

       The proxy assigns each virtual connection a unique identifier using the client-id field in the LbxNewCli
       ent request. This client-id is used in the LBX protocol to specify the current client (see the LbxSwitch 
       request and the LbxSwitchEvent). client-id 0 is reserved for the proxy control connection. An LbxCli
       ent error will result if the LbxNewClient request contains a client-id of 0 or an already in use client-id.
<P>

       If the server rejects this new virtual connection, the server sends a core X connection failure reply to the 
       proxy. The current version of LBX does not support the return of an Authenticate reply.
<P>

       If the change-type field is set to NoDeltas, then connection-data is sent using the CONINFO structure, 
       which is identical to the additional data of the core connection reply. If the tag-id is non-zero, then the con
       nection-data is stored by the proxy using this tag value. Tagged connection data must be stored by the proxy, 
       and can not be invalidated by the proxy until an LbxInvalidateTag event is received for that tag.
<P>

       When the change-type field is not set to NoDeltas, then connection data is sent as changes against connec
       tion information previously sent to the proxy. The tag-id field, if non-zero, has the tag of the previously sent 
       data to apply the changes to. A zero tag-id indicates that the changes are with respect to the connection infor
       mation sent when the proxy connected to the server.
<P>

       If the change-type field is set to NormalClientDeltas, then connection-data is sent using the CONDIF 
       structure. The values in the CONDIF structure are substituted for the identically named fields of the connec
       tion information for the new connection.
<P>

       If the change-type field is set to AppGroupDeltas, then connection-data is sent using the CONDI
       FROOT structure. The root, root-visual, and default-colormap fields, when nonzero, are substituted for the 
       corresponding fields in the reference connection information. The white-pixel and black-pixel fields are sub
       stituted only when the default-colormap field of the reply is non-zero. When default-colormap field of the 
       reply is zero, so are white-pixel and black-pixel. The first entry in the root-input-masks field is the current-
       input-mask for the default root window. The remaining entries in root-input-masks are input masks for non-

       This request asks the server for control of allocating new colormap cells in the specified colormap. The 
       server grants control by replying to this request. If no changes have occurred since the last time this proxy 
       grabbed this colormap, then the smart-grab field of the reply is set to true, and the optional fields are not 
       sent. Otherwise, the current contents of the colormap are placed in the reply, as described later in this sec
       tion.
<P>

       Once the proxy has received the reply, it can use the LbxAllocColor request to allocate new colormap 
       cells without the performance penalty of round trips. The proxy is still permitted to use the normal colormap 
       and LbxIncrementPixel requests while the colormap is grabbed. The grab is valid across all virtual 
       connections of the proxy.
<P>

       The LbxGrabCmap request is limited to colormaps for the visual types negotiated as part of the colormap 
       algorithm negotiation in the start proxy request at connection setup. 
<P>

       The server and other proxies may not allocate new colormap cells in the colormap while the colormap is 
       grabbed by this proxy. If the server or another proxy needs to allocate new colormap cells, the server sends a 
       LbxReleaseCmap event to the proxy holding the grab, which then issues an LbxReleaseCmap request.
<P>

       The server and other proxies may free colormap cells in a colormap grabbed by a proxy. The server will send 
       an LbxFreeCells event to the proxy that currently has the colormap grabbed when the cell reference 
       count reaches 0.
<P>

       If the colormap is a of a static visual type, such as StaticGray, StaticColor, GrayScale, or 
       TrueColor, then the proxy's grab is immediately released by the server, and the proxy must use LbxIn
       crementPixel requests in place of LbxAllocColor requests for this colormap.
<P>

       If the cmap field does not refer to a valid colormap or the colormap is already grabbed by this proxy then a 
       Colormap error is generated.
<P>

       The reply describes the contents of the colormap via several arguments and a descriptive list containing one 
       or three channels, with each channel describing allocations in the colormap. 
<P>

       The large-pixel argument, if True, specifies that PIXEL indices will be listed as CARD16 quantities instead 
       of CARD8. The auto-release field, if True, indicates that this colormap is of a static visual type and the 
       proxy's grab is immediately released by the server.
<P>

       If three-channels is False, a single channel is enclosed and color values are described using COLORTRI
       PLE, which has fields for red, green and blue. A single channel is used when the visual type is not Direct
       Color or TrueColor.
<P>

       If three-channels is True, separate red, green and blue channel lists are enclosed, for describing a Direct
       Color or TrueColor colormap. Color values for entries in each channel are sent using COLORSINGLE 
       and the corresponding PIXEL value refers to the RGB subfield of the current channel, as defined by the cor
       responding red-mask, green-mask and blue-mask of the visual. 
<P>

       The bits-per-rgb value is one less than the bits-per-rgb-value field of the visual that the colormap belongs to. 
       If the value is 7 or less, then COLORSINGLE values in the descriptive list are sent using CARD8 fields. 
       Otherwise these values are sent using CARD16 fields.
<P>

       The list describing current colormap allocations contains entries of the following types:
<P>

       An LBXPIXELPRIVATE entry indicates that the pixel in the pixel field is unavailable for allocation.
<P>

       An LBXPIXELPRIVATERANGE entry indicates that a contiguous range of pixels are unavailable for allo
       cation. The range is first-pixel to last-pixel, and includes last-pixel.
<P>

       An LBXPIXELALLOC entry indicates that the pixel in the pixel field is allocated as a read-only pixel. The 
       color field carries the color information of the pixel.
<P>

       An LBXPIXELALLOCRANGE entry indicates that a contiguous range of pixels are allocated as read-only. 
       The range starts first-pixel to last-pixel, and includes last-pixel. These fields are followed by a list of COL
       ORSINGLE or COLORTRIPLE, depending on the value of three-channels.
<P>

       A NEXTCHANNEL entry indicates that the next channel of the colormap will be described.
<P>

       A LISTEND entry indicates the end of the colormap description.
<P>

       All pixels not described in the reply are unallocated.

       This request is sent by a proxy that has given colormap grabbed to allocate a new read-only cell in the color
       map. The proxy may substitute this request for the core AllocColor and AllocNamedColor requests. 
<P>

       The pixel field identifies the colormap cell to allocate. The red, green, and blue fields are the hardware spe
       cific color values of the corresponding fields of the core AllocColor request. The mapping to hardware 
       specific colormap values by the proxy is performed using the color algorithm negotiated by LbxStart
       Proxy.
<P>

       For colormaps of static visual types, the LbxIncrementPixel request is used instead of LBX Alloc
       Color.
<P>

       If the cmap field does not identify a grabbed colormap then a BadAccess error is produced. If the pixel 
       field refers to a read-write entry, or the pixel field refers to a pixel outside of the range of this colormap, a

       This request is sent to the server when the client sends an X ChangeProperty request through the proxy. 
       The size of the data is sent with this request, but not the property data itself. The server reply contains a tag 
       identifier for the data, which is stored in the proxy. The proxy must not discard this data before it is sent to 
       the server, or invalidated by the server. This means that before issuing an LbxStopProxy request, or exit
       ing, the proxy must send LbxTagData requests for these items. If the server loses the connection before the

<P>

       If the mode field is Prepend or Append, the tag refers only to the prepended or appended data.
<P>

       If the tag in the reply is zero, then the change was ignored by the server, as defined in the security extension.

       In order to utilize tags in LbxGetProperty for a specific property, the server must first send the complete 
       property data to the proxy and associate this data with a tag. More precisely, the server sends an LbxGet
       Property reply with a new tag, nItems set to the number of items in the property, the size of the property 
       data in the reply length field, and the complete property data in value. The proxy stores the property data in 
       its tag cache and associates it with the specified tag.
<P>

       In response to future LbxGetProperty requests for the same property, if the server thinks that the proxy 
       has the actual property data in its tag cache, it may choose to send an LbxGetProperty reply without the 
       actual property data. In this case, the reply would include a non-zero tag, a zero reply length, and no data for 
       value.
<P>

       If the server chooses not to generate a tagged reply to LbxGetProperty, or for some reason is unable to 
       do so, it would send a reply with a tag of zero, the size of the property data in the reply length field, and the 
       complete property data in value.

       Responses are messages from the server to the proxy that not, strictly speaking, events, replies or errors.

       This response carries an event, reply, or error that has been encoded relative to a message in the response 
       delta cache. The cache-index field is the index into the cache. Each entry in diffs provides a byte offset and 
       replacement value to use in reconstructing the response.

<H1>5      <A NAME="13570">Algorithm Naming</A>
<A HREF="lbxTOC.html">..</A><HR></H1>

       To avoid potential clashes between different but similar algorithms for stream, bitmap, and pixmap compres
       sion, the following naming scheme will be adhered to:
<P>

       Each algorithm has a unique name, which is a STRING8, of the following form: 
<P>

          &lt;organization&gt;-&lt;some-descriptive-name&gt; 
<P>

       The organization field above is the organization name as registered in section 1 of the X Registry (the regis
       try is provided as a free service by the X Consortium.) This prevents conflicts among different vendor's 
       extensions.
<P>

       As an example, the X Consortium defines a zlib-based stream compression algorithm called XC-ZLIB.
<P>

<H1><A NAME="MMM27">6      Encoding
</A><A HREF="lbxTOC.html">..</A><HR></H1>

       The syntax and types used in the encoding are taken from the X protocol encoding. Where LBX defines new 
       types, they are defined earlier in this document. 
<P>

       As in the X protocol, in various cases, the number of bytes occupied by a component will be specified by a 
       lowercase single-letter variable name instead of a specific numeric value, and often some other component 
       will have its value specified as a simple numeric expression involving these variables. Components specified 
       with such expressions are always interpreted as unsigned integers. The scope of such variables is always just 
       the enclosing request, reply, error, event, or compound type structure.
<P>

       For unused bytes, the encode-form is:
<P>

<UL>
<P>       N                                          unused
</UL>
       If the number of unused bytes is variable, the encode-form typically is:
<P>

<UL>
<P>       p                                          unused, p=pad(E)
</UL>
       where E is some expression, and pad(E) is the number of bytes needed to round E up to a multiple of four.
<P>

       pad(E) = (4 - (E mod 4)) mod 4
<P>

       In many of the encodings, the length depends on many variable length fields. The variable L is used to indi
       cate the number of padded 4 byte units needed to carry the request. Similarly, the variable Lpad indicates the 
       number of bytes needed to pad the request to a 4 byte boundary.
<P>

       For counted lists there is a common encoding of NLISTofFOO:
<P>

       NLISTofFOO
<P>

<UL>
<P>       1    m                                     num items
<P>       m    LISTofFOO                             items
</UL>
       For cached GC and Drawables:
<P>

<UL>
<P>       LBXGCANDDRAWUPDATE
<P>       4 or 0 DRAWBLE                             optional drawable
<P>       4 or 0 GC                                  optional GC

<H2><A NAME="MMM50">6.4    Re-encoding of X Events
</A></H2>

       The X protocol requires all X events to be 32 bytes. The LBX server reduces the number of bytes sent 
       between the server and the proxy for some X events by not appending unused pad bytes to the event data. 
       The offsets of X event data are unchanged. The proxy will pad the events to 32 bytes before passing them on 
       to the client.
<P>

       LBX reencodes X event representations into the following sizes, if squishing is enabled:
