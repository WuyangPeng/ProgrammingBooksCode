This directory contains sources in FrameMaker version 4 doc format for 
the DCS3 Draft Consortium Standard for the PEX 5.2 library specification.
    
The Draft Consortium Standard specification is considered to be a viable 
and complete specification.  However, it is not an official X Consortium 
standard because the proof of concept implementation requirement has not 
yet been fulfilled.  This specification will remain in Draft Consortium 
Standard status until the proof of concept criteria have been met.
