.Dt COUNTMAIL 6
.Os NetBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm countmail
.Nd be obnoxious about how much mail you have
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program counts your mail and tells you about it rather obnoxiously.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Nm
was first written by Noah Friedman <friedman@splode.com> in 1993.
This version was written by Charles Hannum <mycroft@mit.edu>.
.Sh CAVEATS
The read loop is horrendously slow on every shell implementation 
tried.
.Nm
uses
from(1) and wc(1) instead, though these are
not shell builtins.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr from 1 .
