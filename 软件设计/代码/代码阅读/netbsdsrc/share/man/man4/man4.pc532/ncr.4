.Sh NAME
.Nm ncr
.Nd NCR5380/DP8490 low level SCSI interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ncr0 at mainbus0 [flags ?]"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides 
.Tn pc532
specific functions for the machine independent ncr5380 driver provided
in the kernel source.
An optional argument
.Ar flags
can be used to disable disconnects for all targets (bit 0), to disable the
use of interrupts (bit 1), to force a SCSI BUS RESET at boot time (bit 2),
to disable SCSI parity checking for certain targets (bits 8-15) and to disable
disconnects for certain targets (bits 16-23).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ncr?: BUS RESET"
A BUS RESET was detected on the SCSI bus.
.It "ncr? spurious interrupt"
The controller caused a processor interrupt for no reason.
.It "ncr? ready timeout"
.It "ncr? pdma not_req timeout"
.It "ncr? timeout waiting for final SCI_DSR_DREQ"
These three messages indicate problems during a pdma transfer.
