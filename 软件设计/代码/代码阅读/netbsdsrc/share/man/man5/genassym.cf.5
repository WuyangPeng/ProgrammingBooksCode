.Sh NAME
.Nm genassym.cf
.Nd assym.h definition file.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is used by 
.Xr genassym.sh 5
to make constant C expressions known to assembler source files.
Lines starting with '#' are discarded by
.Xr genassym.sh 5 .
Lines starting with 
.Em include , 
.Em ifdef ,
.Em if ,
.Em else
or
.Em endif
are proceeded with '#' and passed otherwise unmodied to the C compiler.
Lines starting with
.Em quote
get passed on with the
.Em quote
command removed. The last command
.Xr genassym.sh 5
understands is
.Em define .
The first word after
.Em define
should be a valid CPP identifier. The rest of the line should be a constant
C expression. The output of
.Xr genassym.sh 5
will assign the numerical value of this expression to the CPP identifier.
