.Sh NAME
.Nm bim
.Nd pc532 boot image manager
.Sh SYNOPSIS
bim
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Op Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The pc532 has available an autoboot ROM monitor.  This ROM monitor understands
the BSD disklabel and expects a boot image directory following the
disklabel.  Also, it expects an image partition for the storage of bootable
images.  The image directory and the image partition is managed by
.Nm "" .
The
.Ar device
is the raw disk partition that includes the disklabel.  The default
value of 
.Ar device
is
.Pa /dev/rsd0c .
.Nm
directly accesses both the disklabel and the image partition directly
from the raw disk device.  It does not open the device corresponding
to the boot partition.  
.Pp
The 
.Cm -c command
argument allows 
.Nm
to execute commands given via the command line.  This allows 
.Nm
to be used from scripts.  The
.Cm -c command
argument may be repeated up to 20 times.  The commands
will be executed in the order given.
.Sh DISK INITIALIZATION
.Nm
is typically used as part of the initial setup on a disk.
The disk must be partitioned by using
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
making sure there is a boot boot partition.  This boot
partition is often just after the disklabel.  It must not include
the disklabel.  If 
.Nm
does not detect a boot image directory, it asks if the user wants
one created.  From there, the operation of
.Nm
is completely command driven.  The command interpreter is 
.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm
supports the following commands.
There is on-line documentation for all commands.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "partitions"
.It add
Adds an executable file to the image partition.
.It delete
Deletes an image from the image partition.
.It default
Sets the default image boot.
.It exit
Exit 
.Nm "" .
.It header
Print a small section of the disklabel.
.It help
Print help.
.It images
Print the image partition table.
.It init
Initialize the image partition and associated partition table.
.It partitions
Print the disklabel.
.It quit
Terminate 
.Nm "" .
.It ?
Print help.
.El
.Pp
For the details on these commands, ask for help from
.Nm "" .

.Sh AUTHORS
Bruce Culbertson wrote the basic command interpreter for the pc532
ROM monitor.  Philip A. Nelson took the command interpreter, modified
it to be a more generic command interpreter and added the 
.Nm 
specific code.
