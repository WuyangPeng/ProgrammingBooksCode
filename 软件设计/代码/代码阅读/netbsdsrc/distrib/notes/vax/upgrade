There are no upgrade program for NetBSD/vax, you will have to 
upgrade your system by hand. Anyway, here are small hints about
how to do it:

	* First replace the kernel, /boot and the boot blocks
	  with new ones. The boot system has changed since 1.2.

	* Reboot the system to be sure you run with the new kernel.

	* Untar the wanted distributions. Remember to use the --unlink
	  flag to tar, otherwise you will run into trouble.

	* Reboot the system once again.

	* Now you will (hopefully) be up and running in the new world.

NOTE: you SHOULD NOT extract the `etc' set if upgrading.  Instead, you
should extract that set into another area and carefully merge the changes
by hand.
