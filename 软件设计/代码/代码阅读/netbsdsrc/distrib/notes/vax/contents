The vax-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"vax" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/vax/
			INSTALL		Installation notes; this file.

			binary/		vax binary distribution sets;
					see below.

			security/	vax security distribution;
					see below.

			tk50/		Files to install from tape.

			rx50/		Files to install from RX50 floppy.

			rx33/		Files to install from RX33 floppy.

			netboot/	Files needed when netbooting.

.../vax/netboot/

There are a couple of files in the netboot directory; the boot program
in different flavours, a generic kernel and a miniroot image. The files
are described below:

	boot		The NetBSD loader program, needed to load the
			kernel or any standalone program from disk/tape/net.

	boot.mopformat	The same as above, but in MOP format.

	gennetbsd.gz	A generic NetBSD/vax kernel, gzipped.

	miniroot.tar.gz	A tar'ed and gzipped miniroot, unpack this to 
			get a small netbooted environment.

.../vax/tk50/
.../vax/rx50/
.../vax/rx33/

In these directories there are splitted files of both a small boot
utility filesystem and a miniroot. See the section for installing
to get more about this.

.../vax/binary/

The NetBSD/vax binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the vax.  There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in the "vax/binary" subdirectory of
the NetBSD _VER distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base13	The NetBSD/vax _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 7.6M gzipped, 21.5M uncompressed ]

	comp13	The NetBSD/vax Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 5.4M gzipped, 17.2M uncompressed ]

	etc13	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 68K gzipped, 350K uncompressed ]

	games13	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.9M gzipped, 7.0M uncompressed ]

	man13	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 0.9K gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]

	misc13	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.9M gzipped, 6.5M uncompressed ]

	text13	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 0.8M gzipped, 2.9M uncompressed ]

.../vax/security/

The vax security distribution set is named "secr13" and can be found
in the "vax/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree.  It contains executables which are built in the "src/domestic" portion
if the NetBSD source tree.  It can only be found on those sites which carry
the complete NetBSD distribution and that can legally obtain it.  (Remember,
because of United States law, it may not be legal to distribute this set to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
[ 128K gzipped, 275K uncompressed ]

The vax binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files.
Each vax binary distribution set also has its own "CKSUMS" file, just
as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the command:

	tar --unlink -zxvpf set.tar.gz

from /.   Note that the "--unlink" flags is very important!

For best results, it is recommended that you follow the installation
and/or upgrade procedures documented in this file.
