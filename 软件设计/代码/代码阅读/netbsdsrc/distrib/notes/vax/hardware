Hardware supported by NetBSD/vax _VER includes (but may not be limited to): 

	CPU types:

		VAX 11/750, VAX 11/78{0,5}, VAX 8200/8250/8300/8350,
		VAX 8600/8650, MicroVAX II, MicroVAX III, 
		MicroVAX 3600/3800/3900, MicroVAX 3300/3400/3500,
		MicroVAX 2000/VAXstation 2000 and some VAXstation 3100.

	Networking:
		DEUNA/DELUA Unibus ethernet, DEQNA/DELQA Q22 bus ethernet
		and LANCE chip where available.

	Serial lines:
		DHU11/DHV11/DL11/DLV11/DZ11/DZQ11/DZV11 Unibus/Q22 bus
		asynchronous lines and DZ11-compatible lines on 
		VAXstations.

	Disks:
		UDA50 Unibus MSCP controller, KDA50/RQDX1/2/3 Q22 bus
		MSCP controller, KDB50 BI-bus MSCP controller, MFM and
		SCSI controllers on VAXstations, RP04/05/06/07 and
		RM02/03/05/80 Massbus disks, and Console RL02 on 
		VAX 8600. Some third-party controllers are also
		known to work, other do not.

	Tapes:
		TMSCP on Q22 bus (TK50/70), SCSI tapes on VAXstations.

The minimal configuration requires 2M of RAM and ~40MB of disk space,
but the installation requires at least 4MB RAM and you probably do
not want to run with anything less than that.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise		needed
	root (/)	20M		10M
	user (/usr)	80M		45M
	swap		(2 or 3 * RAM)
	Anything else is up to you!
