.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Nd NFS file locking daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar debug_level
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon provides monitored and unmonitored file and record locking services
in an NFS environment.  To monitor the status of hosts requesting locks,
the locking daemon typically operates in conjunction
with
.Xr rpc.statd 8 .
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm
:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option causes debugging information to be written to syslog, recording
all RPC transactions to the daemon.  These messages are logged with level
LOG_DEBUG and facility LOG_DAEMON.  Specifying a debug_level of 1 results
in the generation of one log line per protocol operation.  Higher
debug levels can be specified, causing display of operation arguments
and internal operations of the daemon.
.El
.Pp
Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
using log level LOG_ERR and facility LOG_DAEMON.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon must NOT be invoked by
.Xr inetd 8
because the protocol assumes that the daemon will run from system start time.
Instead, it should be configured in
.Xr rc.conf 5
to run at system startup.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x -compact
.It Pa /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x
RPC protocol specification for the network lock manager protocol.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr rc.conf 5 ,
.Xr rpc.statd 8
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation provides only the server side of the protocol
(i.e. clients running other OS types can establish locks on a NetBSD fileserver,
but there is currently no means for a NetBSD client to establish locks).
.Pp
No actual file or record locking is done.  As such, it is recommended that
NFS locking services be enabled only in environments where vendor NFS
implmentations require them.  Applications which depend upon NFS file or
record locking to protect creation and modification of files may not
operate properly.  Local filesystem locking mechanisms are unaffected.
.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation is based on the specification in X/Open CAE Specification
C218, "Protocols for X/Open PC Interworking: XNFS, Issue 4", ISBN 1 872630 66 9
.Sh HISTORY
A version of
.Nm
appeared in SunOS 4.
