$NetBSD: README,v 1.1 1996/08/22 20:18:10 explorer Exp $

Based on some examples in /usr/share/lkm, I have started adding
loadable modules for some portions of NetBSD I don't think should
require a kernel rebuild to install.

So far, I have added the following:

	cd9660
	fdesc
	kernfs	(slightly different than in /usr/share/lkm)
	msdosfs
	mfs
	nullfs
	portal
	procfs
	umapfs
	union

Building and Testing
--------------------

mkdir /usr/lkm (if it's not there)
	make depend && make && make install

Then, to install cd9660, for example, type:
	modload -v -e cd9660_lkmentry -o /var/run/lkm.cd9660 /usr/lkm/cd9660.o
	(or "make load" in the correct directory)

To remove it from memory, type:
	modunload -n cd9660
	(or "make unload" in the correct directory)

Notes
-----

Currently there is no symbol table management so the in-kernel debugger will
loose.

The LKM interface will (hopefully) be changing into something more usable.
If you use these files as a reference, you might have to change your
code if you want to use the new interface.  I expect the old one to be
supported if it is possible to do so.

COMPAT modules
--------------

The FreeBSD module DOES load, but it will not work without other kernel
modifications.

The Linux module compiles, and also requires other kernel modifications
to run.  It has not been tested.

VFS modules
-----------

These are somewhat tested.  Since this whole system is still under
development use these at your own risk.
