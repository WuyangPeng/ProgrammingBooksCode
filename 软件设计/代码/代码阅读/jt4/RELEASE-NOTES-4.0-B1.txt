==========================
BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
==========================



==============================
KNOWN PROBLEMS IN THIS RELEASE:
==============================


URL Decoding Incomplete
-----------------------
Currently, Catalina does not decode the values returned by getServletPath()
and getPathInfo(), as required by the Servlet Specification.  This will be
dealt with after clarifications to the requirements are completed in the
JSR-053 expert group.


Redeploying From a Web Application Archive
------------------------------------------
If you attempt to undeploy, then redeploy, an application from the same
web application archive file URL (where the URL refers to an actual WAR
file, not to a directory), the redeploy will fail with error "zip file is
closed".  There appears to be a problem in the JDK's JarURLConnection class
where JAR files are cached, even after they are closed, so that a request
for a connection to the same URL returns the previous JarFile object instead
of a new one.  As a workaround, you should do one of the following:
* Change the URL of the web application archive each time you redeploy.
* Deploy from an unpacked directory (on the same server) instead of from
  a WAR file (this is often more convenient in a development environment
  anyway).


Running Web Apps Under A Security Manager
-----------------------------------------
Support for running individual web applications under the protection of a
security manager has not yet been completed.
