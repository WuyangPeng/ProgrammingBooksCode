<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A <strong>Valve</strong> component represents an instance of a specified
Java class that will be involved in the processing of each request and response
handled by the <strong>Container</strong> within which it is nested,
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Valve nested inside an <a href="engine.html">Engine</a> will process
    all requests received by any <strong>Connector</strong> associated with
    the <a href="service.html">Service</a> in which this Engine is nested.</li>
<li>A Valve nested inside a <a href="host.html">Host</a> will process all
    requests received by the associated <a href="engine.html">Engine</a> and
    directed to the specified virtual host, but not requests directed to any
    other virtual host associated with that Engine.</li>
<li>A Valve nested inside a <a href="context.html">Context</a> will process
    all requests received by the associated <a href="host.html">Host</a>, and
    mapped to the specified web application, but not requests mapped to any
    other web application associated with that Host.</li>
</ul>

<p>Valves are typically used to implement optional features for the associated
Container.  See the "Special Features" section of the documentation on
<a href="engine.html">Engine</a>, <a href="host.html">host</a>, and
<a href="context.html">Context</a> Containers for more information about the
Valves designed to be associated with each Container type.  This page
summarizes the configuration information for all standard Valve implementations
that are provided with Catalina.</p>

<a name="Common Attributes"></a>
<h2>Common Attributes</h2>

<p>All implementations of the <strong>Valve</strong> component support the
following attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>className</code></td>
    <td>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.Valve</code> interface.
        Because there is no single standard implementation, this attribute
        is required.  See <a href="#Standard Implementation Attributes">
        Standard Implementation Attributes</a> for the names of the
        supported classes.
    </td>

<a name="Standard Implementation Attributes"></a>
<h2>Standard Implementation Attributes</h2>

<p>Unlike most other Catalina components, there is not a single standard
implementation of the <strong>Valve</strong> component available.  Instead,
a variety of standard implementations, with different functional purposes,
are available for your use.  To select one, use the specified value for the
<code>className</code> attribute, and configure the remaining attributes
as described below.</p>


<a name="AccessLogValve"></a>
<h3>Access Log Valve (<code>org.apache.catalina.valve.AccessLogValve</code>)</h3>

<p>The <strong>Access Log Valve</strong> creates log files in the same format
as those created by standard web servers.  These logs can later be analyzed
by standard log analysis tools to track page hit counts, user session activity,
and so on.  The access log Valve shares many configuration characteristics with
the <a href="logger.html#FileLogger">File Logger</a>
components used to record internal event, exception, and debugging output from
Catalina components, including the automatic rollover of log files at
midnight each night.  An Access Log Valve can be associated with an
<a href="engine.html">Engine</a>, <a href="host.html">Host</a>, or
<a href="context.html">Context</a> Container, and will log requests processed
by the associated Container and any nested Containers.</p>

<p>The Access Log Valve supports the following additional attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>directory</code></td>
    <td>Relative or absolute pathname of the directory into which log
        files will be created.  If a relative path is specified, it is
        interpreted as relative to $CATALINA_HOME.  If no directory is
        specified, the default value is "logs" (relative to the
        Catalina home directory).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>pattern</code></td>
    <td>A formatting layout identifying the various information fields
        from the request and response to be logged, or the word
        <code>common</code> to select the standard Common Log Format.
        See below for more information on pattern variables.  If no
        value is specified, the <code>common</code> format is utilized.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>prefix</code></td>
    <td>The prefix added to the front of each log file name.  If not
        specified, the default value is "access_log.".  To specify no
        prefix, use a zero-length string.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>resolveHosts</code></td>
    <td>Should the IP address of the remote client for each request be
        resolved to the corresponding host name (via a DNS lookup)?  You
        might wish to turn off host resolution to improve performance
        in high activity web applications.  If not specified, the default
        value is <code>false</code>, indicating that remote host resolution
        will not take place.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>suffix</code></td>
    <td>The suffix added to the end of each log file name.  If not
        specified, the default value is "".  To specify no suffix,
        use a zero-length string.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>timestamp</code></td>
    <td>Should log messages be date/time stamped?  Set this value to
        <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  If not specified,
        log messages will not be date/time stamped.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>Values for the <code>pattern</code> attribute are made up of literal text
strings, and pattern identifiers prefixed by the <strong>%</strong> character,
which cause replacement by the corresponding variable value from the current
request and response.  The following pattern codes are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>%a</b> - Remote IP address</li>
<li><b>%A</b> - Local IP address</li>
<li><b>%b</b> - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers, or '-' if zero</li>
<li><b>%B</b> - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers</li>
<li><b>%h</b> - Remote host name (or IP address if resolveHosts is false)</li>
<li><b>%H</b> - Request protocol</li>
<li><b>%l</b> - Remote logical username from identd (always returns '-')</li>
<li><b>%m</b> - Request method (GET, POST, etc.)</li>
<li><b>%p</b> - Local port on which this request was received</li>
<li><b>%q</b> - Query string (prepended with a '?' if it exists)</li>
<li><b>%r</b> - First line of the request (method and request URI)</li>
<li><b>%s</b> - HTTP status code of the response</li>
<li><b>%t</b> - Date and time, in Common Log Format</li>
<li><b>%u</b> - Remote user that was authenticated (if any), else '-'</li>
<li><b>%U</b> - Requested URL path</li>
<li><b>&v</b> - Local server name</li>
</ul>

<p>If you specify a pattern of <code>common</code>, or do not specify a pattern
at all, the common pattern <code>%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b</code> is used, which
corresponds to the default logging format for many web servers.</p>


<a name="RemoteAddressFilter"></a>
<h3>Remote Address Filter (<code>org.apache.catalina.valve.RemoteAddrValve</code>)</h3>

<p>The <strong>Remote Address Filter</strong> allows you to compare the IP
address of the client that submitted this request against one or more
<em>regular expressions</em>, and either allow the request to continue
or refuse to process a request from this client based on the outcome of the
comparison.  A Remote Address Filter can be associated with an
<a href="engine.html">Engine</a>, <a href="host.html">Host</a>, or
<a href="context.html">Context</a> Container, and will filter requests
processed by the associated Container and any nested Containers.</p>

<p>The Remote Address Filter supports the following additional attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>allow</td>
    <td>A comma-separated list of <em>regular expression</em> patterns that
        the remote client's IP address is compared to.  If this attribute is
        specified, the remote address <strong>must</strong> match at least
        one of the patterns to be allowed.  If this attribute is not
        specified, all requests are allowed unless the remote address
        matches a <code>deny</code> pattern.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>deny</td>
    <td>A comma-separated list of <em>regular expression</em> patterns that
        the remote client's IP address is compared to.  If this attribute is
        specified, the remote address <strong>must not</strong> match any of
        the specified patterns to be allowed.  If this attribute is not
        specified, any request where the remote address matches one of the
        <code>accept</code> patterns is allowed.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>


<a name="RemoteHostFilter"></a>
<h3>Remote Host Filter (<code>org.apache.catalina.valve.RemoteHostValve</code>)</h3>

<p>The <strong>Remote Host Filter</strong> allows you to compare the remote
host address of the client that submitted this request against one or more
<em>regular expressions</em>, and either allow the request to continue
or refuse to process a request from this client based on the outcome of the
comparison.  A Remote Host Filter can be associated with an
<a href="engine.html">Engine</a>, <a href="host.html">Host</a>, or
<a href="context.html">Context</a> Container, and will filter requests
processed by the associated Container and any nested Containers.</p>

<p>The Remote Address Host supports the following additional attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>allow</td>

        specified, all requests are allowed unless the remote address
        matches a <code>deny</code> pattern.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>deny</td>
    <td>A comma-separated list of <em>regular expression</em> patterns that
        the remote client's host address is compared to.  If this attribute is
        specified, the remote address <strong>must not</strong> match any of

<a name="RequestDumperValve"></a>
<h3>Request Dumper Valve (<code>org.apache.catalina.valve.RequestDumperValve</code>)</h3>

<p>The <strong>Request Dumper Valve</strong> is a debugging tool that lets you
insert a component that dumps the HTTP headers associated with the specified
request (before processing) and response (after processing) to the
<a href="logger.html">Logger</a> that is associated with our corresponding
Container.  It is especially useful when trying to debug problems related to
headers or cookies sent by an HTTP client.  A Request Dumper Filter can be
associated with an <a href="engine.html">Engine</a>,
<a href="host.html">Host</a>, or <a href="context.html">Context</a> Container,
and will log requests processed by the associated Container and any nested
Containers.</p>

<p>The Request Dumper Filter supports no additional attributes.</p>
