<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>An <strong>Engine</strong> component represents the entire Catalina servlet
container.  A single instance of an <b>Engine</b> component
is configured for each <a href="service.html">Service</a>, to receive
all requests received by one or more <strong>Connector</strong>
components.  This element must be nested immediately after the
<strong>Connector</strong> elements, inside the owning
<a href="service.html">Service</a> element.</p>

<p>Request processing <a href="valve.html">Valves</a> that are nested
here will be executed for every request received from every
<strong>Connector</strong> configured within this service.</p>

<br>


<a name="Common Attributes"></a>
<h2>Common Attributes</h2>

<p>All implementations of the <strong>Engine</strong> component support the
following attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>className</code></td>
    <td>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.Engine</code> interface.  If
        no class name is specified, the standard implementation will be
        used (<code>org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine</code>).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>defaultHost</code></td>
    <td>The default host name, identifying the
        <a href="host.html">Host</a> to which requests from unidentified
        remote hosts will be directed.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>name</code></td>
    <td>The logical name of this engine.  The name selected is arbitrary,
        but it is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>


<a name="Standard Implementation Attributes"></a>
<h2>Standard Implementation Attributes</h2>

<p>The standard implementation of the <strong>Engine</strong> component also
supports the following attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>debug</code></td>
    <td>
      The level of debugging detail logged by this <strong>Engine</strong>
      to the associated Logger, with higher numbers generating more detailed
      output.  If not specified, the debugging detail level will be set to
      zero (0).
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>


<a name="Utility Components"></a>
<h2>Utility Components</h2>

<p>You can attach one or more of the following utility components by nesting
a corresponding declaration inside your <strong>Engine</strong> element.
Unless overridden by a utility component of the same name being nested in a
<a href="host.html">Host</a> or <a href="context.html">Context</a> element,
the utility components you declare here will be shared among all virtual
hosts and web applications running in this <strong>Engine</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="logger.html">Logger</a> - Configure a logger that will receive
      all log messages from this <strong>Engine</strong>, plus log messages
      from <strong>Connectors</strong> attached to this Engine.  In
      addition, this Logger will log messages from subordinate
      <a href="host.html">Hosts</a> and <a href="context.html">Contexts</a>,
      unless overridden by a Logger configuration at a lower level.
  </li>
  <li><a href="realm.html">Realm</a> - Configure a realm that will allow your
      database of users, and their associated roles, to be shared across all
      of the Hosts, and all web applications running within these Hosts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Features</h2>

<h3>Access Logs</h3>

<p>When you run a web server, one of the output files normally generated is
an <i>access log</i>, which generates one line of information, in a standard
format, for each HTTP request that was received, and responded to, by the
web server.  Catalina includes an optional <a href="valve.html">Valve</a>
implementation that can create access logs in the same standard format
created by web servers, or in any custom format desired.</p>

<p>You can ask Catalina to create an access log for all requests to any
web application for any <strong>Host</strong>, by nesting an element like
this inside your <b>Engine</b> element:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Engine name="engine" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve"
             prefix="catalina_access_log." suffix=".txt"
             pattern="common"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Engine&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#AccessLogValve">Access Log Valve</a> for more
information on the configuration options that are supported.</p>

<h3>Lifecycle Listeners</h3>

<p>If you have implemented a Java object that needs to know when this Engine
is started or stopped, you can declare it by nesting a
<code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;Engine&gt;</code>
element.  The class you specify in the <code>className</code> attribute
of this Listener must implement the
<code>org.apache.catalina.LifecycleListener</code> interface, and it will be
notified about the occurrence of the corresponding lifecycle events.</p>

<p>Configuration for such a listener might look like this:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Engine name="engine" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Listener className="com.mycompany.MyEngineListener"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Engine&gt;

</pre>

<h3>Request Filters</h3>

<p>You can ask Catalina to check the IP address, or host name, of an
incoming request for the entire servlet container
against a list of "accept" and "deny" filters, which are
defined using the Regular Expression syntax supported by the jakarta-regexp
regular expression library system.  Requests that come from remote locations
that are not accepted will be rejected with an HTTP "Forbidden" error.
Example filter declarations:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Engine name="engine" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteHostValve"
             allow="*.mycompany.com,www.yourcompany.com"/&gt;
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
             deny="192.168.1.*"
      ...
    &lt;/Engine&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#RemoteAddressFilter">Remote Address Filter</a> or
<a href="valve.html#RemoteHostFilter">Remote Host Filter</a> for more
information on the syntax of these filters, and the logic that is applied
when they are executed.</p>
