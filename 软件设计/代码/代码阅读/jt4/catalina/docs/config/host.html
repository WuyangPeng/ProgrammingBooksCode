<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A <strong>Host</strong> component represents a "virtual host" that is
running in an instance of Catalina, possibly in conjunction with many other
virtual hosts.  Each virtual host can be running one or more web applications,
each represented by a <a href="context.html">Context</a> component.</p>

<p>In order for a client, such as a web browser, to successfully send a
request to a web application running in a particular virtual host, the client
must specify a hostname that is mapped, in the Domain Name Service (DNS) to
the server that Catalina is running on, and a port number on which you have
defined a <strong>Connector</strong> to be listening.</p>

<p>You must define at least one <strong>Host</strong> component nested inside
each <a href="engine.html">Engine</a> element.  Typically, this Host will be
named <code>localhost</code>, and will be declared as the default host for
the owning Engine.</p>

<p>Request processing <a href="valve.html">Valves</a> that are nested
here will be executed for every request received for processing by this
virtual host.</p>

<br>


<a name="Common Attributes"></a>
<h2>Common Attributes</h2>

<p>All implementations of the <strong>Host</strong> component support the
following attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>appBase</code></td>
    <td>The "application base" directory for this virtual host.  This is
        the pathname of a directory that may contain web applications to
        be executed in this virtual host.  You may specify an absolute
        pathname to this directory, or a pathname that is relative to the
        "Catalina Home" directory.  If not specified, the default value
        (<code>webapps</code>) will be used.  See the
        <a href="#Special Features">Special Features</a> section, below,
        for information about Automatic Application Deployment support
        provided by the standard Host implementation.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>className</code></td>
    <td>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.Host</code> interface.  If
        no class name is specified, the standard implementation will be
        used (<code>org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHost</code>).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>name</code></td>
    <td>The host name of this virtual host.  This name must match the
        name submitted on the <code>Host:</code> header in incoming
        requests.  This attribute is required, and must be unique among
        the virtual hosts running in this servlet container.  Note that
        hostname matching is <strong>not</strong> case sensitive.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<a name="Standard Implementation Attributes"></a>
<h2>Standard Implementation Attributes</h2>

<p>The standard implementation of the <strong>Host</strong> component also
supports the following attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>debug</code></td>
    <td>
      The level of debugging detail logged by this <strong>Host</strong>
      to the associated Logger, with higher numbers generating more detailed
      output.  If not specified, the debugging detail level will be set to
      zero (0).
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>unpackWARs</code></td>
    <td>
      Set to <code>true</code> if you want web applications that are deployed
      from a Web Application Archive (WAR) file to be unpacked into a disk
      directory structure (as was done in Tomcat 3.x), or <code>false</code>
      to run the application directly from the WAR file.  If not specified,
      the default value is <code>true</code> for backwards compatibility.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<br>


<a name="Utility Components"></a>
<h2>Utility Components</h2>

<p>You can attach one or more of the following utility components by nesting
a corresponding declaration inside your <strong>Host</strong> element.
Unless overridden by a utility component of the same name being nested in a
<a href="context.html">Context</a> element,
the utility components you declare here will be shared among all 
web applications running in this <strong>Host</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="logger.html">Logger</a> - Configure a logger that will receive
      all log messages from this <strong>Host</strong>, as well as from all web
      applications running on this <strong>Host</strong>.</li>
  <li><a href="realm.html">Realm</a> - Configure a realm that will allow your
      database of users, and their associated roles, to be shared across all
      of the web applications running within this <strong>Host</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Special Features"></a>
<h2>Special Features</h2>

<h3>Access Logs</h3>

<p>When you run a web server, one of the output files normally generated is
an <i>access log</i>, which generates one line of information, in a standard
format, for each HTTP request that was received, and responded to, by the
web server.  Catalina includes an optional <a href="valve.html">Valve</a>
implementation that can create access logs in the same standard format
created by web servers, or in any custom format desired.</p>

<p>You can ask Catalina to create an access log for all requests to any
web application for this <strong>Host</strong>, by nesting an element
like this inside your <strong>Host</strong> element:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Host name="localhost" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve"
             prefix="localhost_access_log." suffix=".txt"
             pattern="common"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Host&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#AccessLogValve">Access Log Valve</a> for more
information on the configuration options that are supported.</p>

<h3>Automatic Application Deployment</h3>

<p>If you are using the standard <strong>Host</strong> implementation,
the following actions take place automatically when Catalina is first
started.  All processing takes place in the application base directory
configured by the <code>appBase</code> property.
No special configuration is required to enable these activities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any web application archive file (that is, a JAR file whose name ends
    with ".war"), that does not have a corresponding directory of the same
    name without the extension, will be automatically expanded.  The assumption
    is that this is a web application archive being deployed on this virtual
    host.  (If you wish to redeploy an updated WAR file, be sure to delete
    the automatically expanded directory first).</li>
<li>Any subdirectory within the <code>appBase</code> directory that appears
    to be an unpacked web application (i.e. it contains a
    <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code> file), receives an automatically generated
    <a href="context.html">Context</a> element, even if this directory is
    not specifically mentioned in the <code>conf/server.xml</code> file.
    The context path for this application will be a slash character ("/")
    followed by the directory name, unless the directory name is
    <code>ROOT</code>, in which case the context path will be "" (the
    empty string).</li>
</ul>

<p>The net effect of this feature is that you need not specifically mention
your web applications in the <code>conf/server.xml</code> file unless you wish
to define non-default properties for the corresponding
<a href="context.html">Context</a>.

<h3>Host Name Aliases</h3>

<p>In many server environments, the system administrator has set up more
than one host name in the Domain Name Service (DNS) entries for a company,
and you would like all of these names to access the same <strong>Host</strong>
component (and therefore execute the same web applications), no matter
which host name was actually used in the request.</p>

<p>As an example of this, consider that many web sites are set up so that
hostnames <code>www.mycompany.com</code> and <code>mycompany.com</code>
go to the same pages.  You can accomplish this with Catalina by setting
up your server configuration like this:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;Host name="www.mycompany.com" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Alias name="mycompany.com"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Host&gt;
</pre>

<p>With this setup, both of the following URLs will resolve to the same
web application (assuming your <strong>Connector</strong>
is listening on port 8080):
<pre>
	http://mycompany.com:8080
	http://www.mycompany.com:8080
</pre>

<h3>Lifecycle Listeners</h3>

<p>If you have implemented a Java object that needs to know when this
<strong>Host</strong> is started or stopped, you can declare it by nesting a
<code>&lt;Listener&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;Host&gt;</code>
element.  The class you specify in the <code>className</code> attribute
of this Listener must implement the
<code>org.apache.catalina.LifecycleListener</code> interface, and it will be
notified about the occurrence of the corresponding lifecycle events.</p>

<p>Configuration for such a listener might look like this:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Host name="www.mycompany.com" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Listener className="com.mycompany.MyHostListener"/&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/Host&gt;

</pre>

<h3>Request Filters</h3>

<p>You can ask Catalina to check the IP address, or host name, of an
incoming request for this virtual host
against a list of "accept" and "deny" filters, which are
defined using the Regular Expression syntax supported by the jakarta-regexp
regular expression library system.  Requests that come from remote locations
that are not accepted will be rejected with an HTTP "Forbidden" error.
Example filter declarations:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Host name="localhost" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteHostValve"
             allow="*.mycompany.com,www.yourcompany.com"/&gt;
      &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
             deny="192.168.1.*"
      ...
    &lt;/Host&gt;

</pre>

<p>See <a href="valve.html#RemoteAddressFilter">Remote Address Filter</a> or
<a href="valve.html#RemoteHostFilter">Remote Host Filter</a> for more
information on the syntax of these filters, and the logic that is applied
when they are executed.</p>


<h3>User Web Applications</h3>

<p>Many web servers automtically map a request path starting with a
tilde character ("~") and a username to a directory (commonly named
<code>public_html</code>) in that user's home directory on the server.
You can accomplish this with Catalina by setting up your server
configuration like this (on a Unix system that uses the
<code>/etc/passwd</code> file to configure valid users):</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Host name="www.mycompany.com" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Listener className="org.apache.catalina.startup.UserConfig"
                directoryName="public_html"
                userClass="org.apache.catalina.startup.PasswdUserDatabase"/>
      ...
    &lt;/Host&gt;

</pre>

<p>On a server where <code>/etc/passwd</code> is not in use, but one or
more user home directories can be found in a common base directory (such
as <code>c:\Homes</code>), you could do this instead:</p>
<pre>

    &lt;Host name="www.mycompany.com" ...&gt;
      ...
      &lt;Listener className="org.apache.catalina.startup.UserConfig"
                directoryName="public_html"
                homeBase="c:\Homes"
                userClass="org.apache.catalina.startup.HomesUserDatabase"/>
      ...
    &lt;/Host&gt;

</pre>
<p>It is also acceptable to include more than one instance of this listener,
if you have more than one home base directory containing user home
directories.  In all cases, the <a href="context.html">Context</a> that is
set up for user directories will have default values, just as is the case
for Automatic Application Deployment, described above.</p>

<p>With either setup, if my username on the server is <code>craigmcc</code>,
and I have a web application installed in a <code>public_html</code>
subdirectory under my home directory, my application will receive all
requests directed to:</p>
<pre>
	http://www.mycompany.com:8080/~craigmcc
</pre>
<p>assuming my <strong>Connector</strong> is listening on
port 8080.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>:  The operating system username under which
Catalina is executed must have read access to the user's web application,
and all directories above it, for this feature to operate correctly.</p>
