<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Like many server applications, Catalina installs a variety of class loaders
(that is, classes that extend <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code>) to allow
different portions of the container, and the web applications running on the
container, to have access to different repositories of available classes and
resources.  This mechanism is used to provide the functionality defined in
the Servlet API Specification, version 2.3 (public draft 1) -- in particular
sections 9.4 and 9.6.</p>

<p>The remainder of this document provides an overview diagram of the
parent - child relationships between each class loader that is created, more
detailed information about the content and use of each class loader, and
some additional relevant notes.</p>

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h3>Overview Diagram</h3>

<p>In a Java2 environment, class loaders are arranged in a parentage tree.
Normally, when a class loader is asked to load a class (or get a resource),
it delegates the request upwards first, and only searches its local
repositories if the parent class loader(s) cannot find the requested class
or resource.  The model for web applications differs slightly from this, as
discussed further below.</p>

<p>The class loaders that Catalina uses are organized as follows, where
the parent class loader is above the child class loaders:</p>
<pre>
                      Bootstrap
                          |
                       System
                          |
                       Common
                      /      \
                 Catalina   Shared
                           /     \
                       Webapp1  Webapp2 ...
                         /          /
                      Jasper1   Jasper2

</pre>

<p>The usage of and repositories contained in each class loader are
described further below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> - This class loader contains the basic
    runtime classes provided by the Java Virtual Machine, such as the
    <code>java.*</code> classes.  Depending on how your particular JVM
    is organized, this may actually be more than one class loader, or
    may not exist at all.  It is generally not referenced directly.</li>
<li><strong>System</strong> - This class loader is initialized from the
    contents of the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, and
    contains classes that must be visible to both the Catalina internal
    classes and to web applications.  The standard Catalina startup scripts
    assemble the following repositories for the system class path:
    <ul>
    <li><code>$CATALINA_HOME/bin/bootstrap.jar</code> - The Bootstrap class
        that is used to initialize the Catalina server, and the class
        loader implementation classes it depends on.</li>
    <li><code>$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar</code> - The Javac
        compiler used to compile the servlets generated from JSP pages
        (if present on your system).</li>
    </ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong> - This class loader is initialized to include all 
    unpacked classes in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/common/classes</code>
    directory (if it exists), and all JAR files in the
    <code>$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib</code> directory (if it exists).  The
    latter group normally includes the following:
    <ul>
    <li><code>jndi.jar</code> - The Java Naming and Directory Service API
        classes (loaded <strong>only</strong> if not already included in
        the JDK, as they are with JDK 1.3).</li>
    <li><code>naming.jar</code> - The JNDI implementation used by
        Tomcat 4 itself.</li>
    <li><code>servlet.jar</code> - The servlet and JSP API classes.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li><strong>Catalina</strong> - This class loader is initialized to include all
    unpacked classes in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/server/classes</code>
    directory (if it exists), and all JAR files in the
    <code>$CATALINA_HOME/server/lib</code> directory (if it exists).  Because
    these classes are loaded from a separate class loader, which is not visible
    to the <strong>Webapp</strong> class loader, they are <em>not</em> visible
    to web applications.</li>
<li><strong>Shared</strong> - This class loader is initialized to include all
    unpacked classes in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/classes</code> directory
    (if it exists), and all JAR files in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/lib</code>
    directory (if it exists).  All of the classes in these repositories will
    be visible to all web applications, so they may be used to share
    information between web apps.
    (<strong>NOTE</strong> - this behavior is specific to Tomcat 4.0, and
    will not necessarily be portable to other containers.)</li>
<li><strong>WebappX</strong> - A class loader is created for each web
    application that is installed in Catalina, and initialized to include the
    <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory (if it exists), plus all JAR files
    in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory, for this web app.  Because of
    the parentage hierarchy, web applications can indirectly see (and therefore
    load classes from) the <strong>Shared</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>,
    <strong>System</strong>, and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> class loaders,
    but <em>not</em> from the <strong>Catalina</strong> or
    <strong>JasperX</strong> class loaders.</li>
<li><strong>JasperX</strong> - If and only if a web application utilizes
    Jasper to compile and execute JSP pages, an additional class loader is
    created for each web application.  It is initialized to include all JAR
    files in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/jasper</code> directory, which normally
    includes the Jasper compiler classes and the XML parser that they require.
    Because the parent of this class loader is the <strong>WebappX</strong>
    class loader for this application, the JSP compiler can see all of the
    JavaBean and other classes that are part of this application, but the
    application classes cannot see anything loaded from here (and, in
    particular, will not have access to the XML parser loaded by this
    class loader.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see from the above descriptions, the contents of any
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable already existing in your server
is totally ignored.  If you want to make a JAR file available to all web
applications, you <em>must</em> place a copy of this file in the
<code>$CATALINA_HOME/lib</code> directory so that it becomes part of the
<strong>Shared</strong> class loader's repositories.</p>

<a name="Process"></a>
<h3>Web Application Class Loading Process</h3>

<p>When a servlet (or JSP page) within a web application references a class
for the first time (either by using the <code>new</code> operator or by
calling the <code>Class.forName()</code> method), the following processing
occurs to locate and load the requested class:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>loadClass()</code> method of the <strong>WebappX</strong> class
    loader is called to load the specified class.</li>
<li>If this class has been previously loaded by this class loader, the
    cached copy is returned again.  This avoids having to do potentially
    expensive I/O every time a class is requested.</li>
<li>If the class to be loaded is a Java core class (<code>java.*</code>),
    it is loaded directly by the <strong>System</strong> class loader.</li>
<li>If Catalina is running under a security manager (which is normally the
    case), the class loading permissions in the policy file are checked.  If
    the specified policies prohibit loading the named class, the class loader
    will log the violation attempt and return a
    <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>.</li>
<li>If this class loader's <code>delegate</code> property is set to
    <code>true</code> (which is <em>not</em> the default), we will ask our
    parent class loader to load this class before looking locally.  This is
    the standard Java2 delegation model, but prevents a web application from
    overriding a class from the <strong>Shared</strong> class loader with its
    own copy from <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> or a JAR file in
    <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>.</li>
<li>The local repositories are searched next, starting with the
    <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory (if it exists), and then the JAR
    files in <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>.</li>
<li>If we still have not found the class, and did not delegate earlier, we
    delegate to our parent class loader (i.e. the <strong>Shared</strong>
    class loader, which will attempt to load the class itself or delegate
    upwards.  This process continues until the class is found, or we have
    reached the top of the class loader hierarchy.</li>
<li>If the class has still not been found, <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>
    is thrown, as required by the Javadocs for a class loader.</li>
</ol>

<p>A similar pattern is followed when you call <code>Class.getResource()</code>
or <code>Class.getResourceAsStream()</code> to access resources that are
co-resident with your classes.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3>

<h4>Class Loader Information Exposed For Web Applications</h4>

<p>Certain web application components (such as the Jasper JSP page compiler
servlet, require additional information related to class loading to operate
successfully.  To avoid creating dependencies between the Jasper and Catalina
code bases, this information is exposed as a set of servlet context attributes
that are initialized when the web application is started.  The following
context attributes are created:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>org.apache.catalina.classloader</strong> - The <em>Webapp</em>
class loader for this application (which will also be the class loader used
to load the Jasper servlet itself).</li>
<li><strong>org.apache.catalina.jsp_classpath</strong> - A String
representation of the directories and JAR files available in the
<em>webapp</em>, <em>shared</em>, and <em>system</em> class loaders, with
each repository separated by the appropriate path separator character for
the platform this server is running on.</li>
</ul>

<h4>A Note On XML Parsers</h4>

<p>Previously, the Jasper page compiler was loaded in the
<strong>Shared</strong> class loader, along with the XML parser that it
requires.  This had the side effect of causing this XML parser to be visible
to all web applications, through the inheritance hierarchy.  However, this
causes problems if the JAR files of the selected XML parser are sealed (as are
the JAR files in the JAXP 1.1 reference implementation, for example) -- any
attempt to load your own XML parser (such as Xerces) from
<code>WEB-INF/lib</code> would cause "package sealing violation" errors to be
thrown.</p>

<p>Now that the XML parser required by Jasper is loaded from the
<strong>JasperX</strong> class loader, rather than the <strong>Shared</strong>
class loader, this problem no longer occurs.  However, any web application that
relied on an XML parser being made available by Catalina will fail, because
this is no longer true by default.  If your web application requires an XML
parser, you have three choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the XML parser's JAR file(s) in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>
    directory of your web application.</li>
<li>Move the XML parser JAR files from the "jasper" directory to the "lib"
    directory so that the parser is visible both to Jasper and to your
    web applications.</li>
<li>Place the XML parser's JAR file(s) in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/lib</code>
    directory so that they are available to all web applications.  Note that
    this is likely to introduce "package sealing violation" problems again,
    so this option is only practical if your applications do not require
    JSP pages.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional Information</h4>

<p>For more information about class loaders in general, see the Java Language
Specification, and the Javadocs for the following classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code>
<li><code>java.net.URLClassLoader</code>
</ul>

<p>The implementation class for all Catalina internal class loaders is
<code>StandardClassLoader</code>.  Required and available optional packages
are described using the <code>Extension</code> class.  For more information,
see the source code and/or Javadocs for the following classes:
<ul>
<li><code>org.apache.catalina.loader.StandardClassLoader</code>
<li><code>org.apache.catalina.loader.Extension</code>
</ul>
