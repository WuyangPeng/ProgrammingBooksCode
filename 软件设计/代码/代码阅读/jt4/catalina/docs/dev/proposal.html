<h1>1.  INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2>1.1 BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>In June 1999, Sun announced that they were contributing the source code
of the Tomcat servlet container, and the Josper (later Jasper) JSP engine,
to the Jakarta project <http://jakarta.apache.org>.  At that time, significant
work had taken place within the Java Apache project <http://java.apache.org>
on a new servlet container design with a component based architecture.  This
architecture offered substantial improvements in the understandability of the
basic pieces of a servlet container, as well as flexibility in customizing
the underlying functionality for different server environments.</p>

<p>With the announcement of Jakarta, interest declined in a new version of
Apache JServ based on this architecture, based on the (quite reasonable)
conclusion that Jakarta would become the successor to Apache JServ when it
became available.  Now that this has occurred, and we have had a chance to
examine the source code, it is clear that the core servlet container portions
of Tomcat (primarily in package <code>org.apache.tomcat.core</code>) are in
need of the same architectural remodel, for the same reasons.</p>

<p>This document proposes just such an architecture for a future
version of Tomcat, based on a core set of interfaces for which a variety
of implementations may be created.  These component implementations can
then interoperate cleanly with other new and existing components, as long
as the interface contracts are honored.</p>

<p>It is expected that conversion to this architecture will require a
major refactoring of the existing Tomcat core package, as well as other
packages with internal dependencies on the core.  It will also require
substantial changes in the deployment configuration files for the engine.
Therefore, it seems appropriate to implement these changes at a <i>major</i>
revision level update of Tomcat.</p>

<h2>1.2 DESIGN GOALS</h2>

<p>The new architecture was designed with the following goals in mind:</p>

<h3>1.2.1 Diverse Deployment Environments</h3>

<p>Tomcat should be easy to configure and deploy in a variety of operational
environments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand-alone HTTP based application and web server, with full
    support for multiple applications and multiple virtual hosts.</li>
<li>Servlet/JSP environment for an existing web server (such as Apache),
    using either embedded process or separate process implementations.</li>
<li>Servlet/JSP environment embedded within an application server
    (such as a J2EE-compatible platform), able to support advanced
    session persistence and load balancing facilities for distributable
    applications.</li>
<li>Servlet/JSP environment providing a web-based administration
    interface for an existing server application (for example,
    a firewall or a DBMS system).</li>
<li>Servlet/JSP environment providing a web-based administration
    interface for an embedded device application (for example,
    a router, a WebTV-type set-top box, or a network of X10-based
    home automation devices).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is accomplished by allowing the deployer to pick and choose among the
required Container and Session implementations needed to support the required
features.</p>

<h3>1.2.2 Plug-In Functionality Support</h3>

<p>Tomcat should allow the server administrator to choose whether or not
certain functionality (such as persistent support for session data, or load
balancing across servers) is required.  In addition, it should be possible
for server developers to provide customized versions of one or more Tomcat
components, and have them interoperate with the remainder of the system
seamlessly.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by virtue of the fact that all interactions between
Tomcat components are based on standard Java interfaces, which can be
implemented in a variety of ways but still interoperate.</p>

<h3>1.2.3 Extensible Request Processing</h3>

<p>Besides the standard request/response processing described in the servlet
API, it is desireable in many environments to support additional request
processing functionality within the server.  Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request checking at the entire server, virtual host, or servlet context
    level.  This is very important in an ISP environment hosting multiple
    applications for multiple customers on the same server.</li>
<li>Security checking integrated with legacy realm resources (provided by
    a surrounding application server, or already used by other legacy
    applications), without requiring this logic to be coded within user
    applications (servlets and JSP pages).</li>
<li>Logging facilities (customized application logs, or standard web server
    style logs when Tomcat runs standalone) at the entire server, virtual host,
    or servlet context level.</li>
</ul>

<p>This goal is met through the use of the <code>Interceptor</code>
architecture (similar in spirit to the <code>Valve</code> architecture
from Apache JServ, as well as the existing Interceptor style support
that already exists within Tomcat.</p>

<h2>1.3 COMPONENT CATEGORIES</h2>

<p>There are three primary families of components in the proposed architecture.
The details for each component will be presented in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Communications Adapter Components</i> are the diverse means by which
    the Tomcat core servlet container is connected to the outside world.  The
    primary interface between the adapter components and the remainder of the
    system is the Request and Response interfaces, which represent the
    <code>HttpServletRequest</code> being processed, and the
    <code>HttpServletResponse</code> being produced, respectively.</li>
<li><i>Servlet Container Components</i> are responsible for accepting a
    Request from a communications adapter
    component, invoking the required processing functionality, and returning
    the corresponding Response.  All container components implement the base
    interface Container, which supports the insertion of
    arbitrary Interceptor layers that can
    participate in request processing without requiring re-implementation
    of the entire underlying Container.</li>
<li><i>Session Management Components</i> include
    Session, which represents an individual
    <code>HttpSession</code>, and Manager, which
    controls the pool of active sessions visible to a particular container.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>2.  PRIMARY ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS</h1>

<h2>2.1 Communications Adapter Components</h2>

<p>The following interfaces define the major components related to
communication adapters:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Adapter</b>.  Representation of a component which,
    by some communications protocol or interface API, receives requests from
    client applications, calls the appropriate processing logic, and returns
    the generated response.  Because the functional requirements of adapters
    vary widely, few common method signatures are required.</li>
<li><b>Request</b>.  Representation of an
    <code>HttpServletRequest</code> that is utilized throughout the Tomcat
    servlet container to represent the incoming request.</li>
<li><b>Response</b>.  Representation of an
    <code>HttpServletResponse</code> that is utilized throughout the Tomcat
    servlet container to represent the generated response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reduced to its essentials, the functional processing performed by an
Adapter is described as follows:
<ul>
<li>Receive a request from a client application (such as a browser via
    HTTP, or a web server via some connection protocol).</li>
<li>Create appropriate Request and Response instances, and populate
    their properties based on the contents of the received request.</li>
<li>Identify an appropriate Container to use
    for processing this request.  For a stand-alone Tomcat installation,
    this will probaby be a singleton Engine
    implementation.  For an adapter attaching Tomcat to a web server
    such as Apache, this step could take advantage of parsing already
    performed within the web server to identify the
    Context, and perhaps even the Wrapper, to be utilized.</li>
<li>Call the <code>invoke()</code> method of the selected container,
    passing the initialized request and response instances as arguments.</li>
<li>Return the headers and data contents of the response created by this
    container to the client application submitting the request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.2 Servlet Container Components</h2>

<h3>2.2.1 Container Components</h3>

<p>The fundamental servlet container interface is named, naturally enough,
Container.  The fundamental responsibility of a
Container is to execute Requests received from a communications Adapter, or
from a parent Container, returning the corresponding Response.  This
responsibility is represented by the <code>invoke()</code> method of the
Container.  Each container is optionally associated with an instance of each
of the Support Components described below, and also has the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of child Container objects representing
    the next hierarchically lower level of responsibility for request
    processing within this Tomcat deployment.  For example, a Container
    representing a virtual host would have child Containers representing
    the web applications defined for that virtual host.</li>
<li>A set of Interceptor objects providing
    plug-in processing layers for this Context.  See the next subsection
    for more information about Interceptors.</li>
<li>A name that is used to uniquely identify this Container in the set of
    children of this Container's parent Container.</li>
<li>A parent Container with which this Container
    is associated.  Parent-child relationships are usually hierarchical,
    with child Containers being responsible for successively smaller subsets
    of all possible requests processed by this Tomcat deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>service()</code> method of a Container is used to implement the
required processing logic of this hierarchical level of a Tomcat deployment,
independent of any Interceptors that may have been defined.  See the following
subsection for more information about how request processing with Interceptors
is actually implemented.</p>

<p>Two extensions of the Container interface
will be used in nearly every deployment of Tomcat:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Context</b>.  Representation of a single
    <code>ServletContext</code> which will typically be associated with a
    child Wrapper container for each defined servlet.</li>
<li><b>Wrapper</b>.  Representation of a single
    servlet definition (which may support multiple servlet instances if the
    servlet itself represents <code>SingleThreadModel</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In an embedded deployment, a single Context
instance, representing the entire embedded web application, will usually be
the highest level Container component utilized.</p>

<p>When Tomcat is executed in a standalone deployment using an HTTP adapter,
the following extensions of the Container interface are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Engine</b>.  Representation of the entire Tomcat
    servlet engine, associated with one or more Host
    implementations (if this deployment supports multiple virtual hosts) or
    one or more Context implementations (if this
    deployment is for a single virtual host).  Generally, the implementation
    of this interface will be deployed as a singleton, with no parent
    container.  Any Interceptor objects
    associated with an Engine will process all requests passed to the
    Tomcat engine.</li>
<li><b>Host</b>.  Representation of a virtual host that is
    associated with a number of Context children.
    The parent container will generally be an Engine.
    This representation is useful when you wish to interpose one or more
    Interceptor objects to process all requests
    to web applications within this virtual host.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2.2 Interceptor Components</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, a Container supports the
definition of a stack of Interceptor objects
that are allowed to participate in request processing both before and after
the <code>service()</code> method of the owning Container is called.  The
functional purpose of Interceptors is best understood by examining several
operational scenarios.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances (each activated Interceptor returns
<code>true</code>, and no exceptions are thrown by an Interceptor or the
<code>service()</code> method of the associated Container), the following
processing logic must be performed by the <code>invoke()</code> method of
a Container:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>preService()</code> method of all Interceptors associated with
    this Container are called, starting with the <b>most</b> recently added
    Interceptor.  It is assumed each <code>preService()</code> method returns
    <code>true</code> to indicate that processing should continue.  It is also
    assumed for this scenario that no exception is thrown.</li>
<li>The <code>service()</code> method of the owning Container itself is called.
    It is assumed for this scenario that no exception is thrown.</li>
<li>The <code>postService()</code> method of all Interceptors associated with
    this Container are called, starting with the <b>least</b> recently added
    Interceptor.  It is assumed for this scenario that no exception is thrown.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A <code>preService()</code> method of an Interceptor is allowed to return
<code>false</code> instead of <code>true</code>.  Doing so is an indication
that this Interceptor has in fact created the corresponding response, and that
no further processing for this request is required.  When such a return
happens, the following changes to the previously described logic occur:
<ul>
<li>The <code>preService()</code> methods of any Interceptors added to this
    Container earlier than the current one are <b>not</b> called.</li>
<li>The <code>service()</code> method of the owning Container itself is
    <b>not</b> called.</li>
<li>The <code>postService()</code> methods of any Interceptors added to this
    Container earlier than the current one are <b>not</b> called.</li>
<li>The <code>postService()</code> methods of the current Interceptor, and
    any Interceptor added to this Container after the current Interceptor,
    <b>are</b> called.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an exception is thrown by any call to a <code>preService()</code>,
<code>service()</code>, or <code>postService()</code> method, all subsequent
method calls described above are skipped.  The exception will be rippled out
to the highest level Container whose <code>invoke()</code> method was
originally called, and from there to the calling Adapter.</p>

<p>The JavaDoc comments for an Interceptor
outlines the requirements described above from the viewpoint of an individual
Interceptor.  Consult this documentation for additional information.</p>

<h3>2.2.3 Support Components</h3>

<p>A single instance of each of the following support components may optionally
be associated with each Container, accessible through the usual JavaBeans
property accessor methods.  As a general rule, a <code>get</code> method
returning such a support component should return the component last specified
by a corresponding <code>set</code> method call, if any; otherwise, a
corresponding <code>get</code> method call to this Container's parent
Container (if any) should be performed.  This approach allows a general
deployment style where support components are only attached at the highest
required hierarchical Container level.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Loader</b>.  Representation of a Java class loader
    used to load executable servlets and other code utilized within a
    container.  The interface defines support for detection of changes in the
    underlying repository (essentially a container-specific class path), and
    the unloading and reloading of all Java classes loaded by this loader.
    </li>
<li><b>Logger</b>.  Representation of the
    <code>log()</code> methods defined in the <code>ServletContext</code>
    interface.  Implementations can store log output wherever desired, or
    integrate it with the log output of the server in which Tomcat is
    embedded.</li>
<li><b>Manager</b>.  Representation of a manager for the
    pool of active sessions associated with this Container.  See the following
    section for more information.</li>
<li><b>Realm</b>.  Representation of a security realm in
    which a user <code>Principal</code> can be authenticated, and from which
    the set of roles associated with that <code>Principal</code> can be
    identified.  Implementations can be created to integrate with existing
    legacy security realms, integrate with the security realm of the server
    in which Tomcat is embedded, or for custom, application-specific,
    security realms.</li>
<li><b>Resources</b>.  Normally, a container implements
    methods like <code>getResource()</code> and
    <code>getResourceAsStream()</code> by accessing data resources included
    with the web application.  In some environments (such as Tomcat connected
    to a web server such as Apache), it is desireable to use the web server's
    facilities to access these resources instead.  This interface allows such
    accesses to be customized.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.3 Session Management Components</h2>

<p>Support for the session management functionality of the servlet API
specification is provided by components that implement the following
interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Manager</b>.  Representation of a collection
    manager for a set of active sessions associated with a container.
    This interface can be extended to support advanced capabilities such
    as session persistence across server restarts, swapping of active
    but idle sessions, and relocation of sessions in a distributed server
    environment.</li>
<li><b>Session</b>.  Representation of an
    <code>HttpSession</code> that is utilized throughout the Tomcat
    servlet container to represent the session and its associated
    user data objects.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>3.  OTHER ISSUES</h1>

<h2>3.1 Component Configuration</h2>

<p>A significant implementation challenge in this architecture is the elegant
initialization and shutdown of the various components.  This proposal suggests
an approach, also used in the Apache JServ architecture, based on the
Lifecycle interface.  The use of this approach
includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation class of a component may <b>optionally</b> implement
    the Lifecycle interface, if it wishes to take
    advantage of the configuration services.</li>
<li>An object factory that creates a new component will perform the following
    logic in its creation method:
    <ul>
    <li>Instantiate a new instance of the component implementation class
        (usually based on a fully qualified Java class name that is configured
        as a parameter of the factory component).</li>
    <li>Determine whether or not the new component implements the
        Lifecycle interface (usually by use of
        the <code>instanceof</code> operator).  If the component does not
        implement Lifecycle, the remaining steps are skipped.</li>
    <li>Call the new component's <code>configure()</code> method, passing
        an XML document fragment (<code>org.w3c.dom.DocumentFragment</code>)
        containing the configuration parameters for this component.  This
        approach is based on the assumption that XML-based configuration files
        will be utilized to configure Tomcat components.  [IMHO it is overkill
        to convert such configuration parameters (which are typically processed
        only once) into an internal <code>XmlTree</code> architecture, as is
        done in the current Tomcat approach.]</li>
    <li>Call the new component's <code>start()</code> method.  Successful
        return from this method (no exception thrown) indicates that the
        component has been completely configured, and is available for normal
        use by other components.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The component's public methods will be called as required during the
    lifetime of this component (often the life of the Tomcat deployment itself,
    but this is not required).</li>
<li>When the server (usually a parent component) wishes to retire a particular
    component from active use, it will perform the following logic:
    <ul>
    <li>Change its own internal state to indicate that this component is
        no longer available.</li>
    <li>Determine whether or not the component implements the
        Lifecycle interface (usually by use of
        the <code>instanceof</code> operator).  If the component does not
        implement Lifecycle, the remaining steps are skipped.</li>
    <li>Call the component's <code>stop()</code> method.  This call tells the
        component to gracefully clean up its resources (for example, a JDBC
        connection pool would close and release all of its allocated
        connections to the underlying database).</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>3.2 Package Naming Suggestions</h2>

<p>The current Tomcat servlet container architecture has nearly all of the
executable code in a single package (<code>org.apache.tomcat.core</code>).
This proposal suggests the following package naming conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>org.apache.tomcat</code> - Contains the interface definitions for
    all of the core components described in this document.</li>
<li><code>org.apache.tomcat.adapter.xxxxx</code> - Contains implementations
    of the each Adapter component, and their
    associated Request and Response components, in subpackages named
    for each implementation.</li>
<li><code>org.apache.tomcat.container.xxxxx</code> - Contains implementations
    of the various Container interfaces, and the
    corresponding support component implementations, in subpackages named
    for each implementation.</li>
<li><code>org.apache.tomcat.session.xxxxx</code> - Contains implementations
    of the Manager and Session interfaces, in subpackages named for
    each implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The suggested naming conventions maximize the ability to localize private
implementation details within a package (through the use of <i>package
private</i> scoping of method names), while encouraging independence between
packages by using only the commonly defined interfaces.</p>

<h2>3.3 Example Interceptor Scenarios</h2>

<p>The following examples illustrate several types of functionality that might
be implemented using the Interceptor feature
of the proposed architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Custom Request Validation</i>.  In an ISP environment, the server
    administrator might wish to add an
    Interceptor that performs site specific
    validation on all incoming requests (if the Interceptor is attached at
    the Engine level, for example), or on all requests to a particular
    customer's virtual host (if the Interceptor is attached at the
    Host level, for example).</li>
<li><i>Enforce Authentication and Access Control Constraints</i>.  An
    Interceptor can be defined to enforce the
    <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code> elements included in a web
    application's deployment descriptor.  Such an Interceptor would include
    logic in the <code>preService()</code> method to examine the incoming
    Request properties.  If an authentication
    challenge is required, the <code>preService()</code> method would
    complete the corresponding Response with
    the correct challenge (based on the configuration specified in the
    corresponding <code>&lt;login-config&gt;</code> element), and return
    <code>false</code> to bypass any remaining processing for this Request.
    </li>
<li><i>Integration with Application Server Functionality</i>.  An application
    server environment might provide services, addressable via a URI, while
    wanting to use standard servlet support as well.  An
    Interceptor could be created that would
    examine the incoming Request for those requiring internal services,
    call the internal service API, construct an appropriate Response,
    and return <code>false</code> from the <code>preService()</code>
    method, to skip remaining request processing within Tomcat.
    Requests that should be processed via normal servlet API functionality
    are passed on by having the <code>preService()</code>
    method return <code>true</code> instead.</li>
<li><i>Performance Measurement</i>.  The processing time required for each
    incoming request can be calculated by starting a timer in the
    <code>preService()</code> method, and stopping that timer in the
    corresponding <code>postService()</code> method of the same
    Interceptor.  Measuring performance at
    this point is useful, because it eliminates the variable overhead of
    communications adapters.  Such measurements may also contribute to
    decisions made by a load balancing module in an application server that
    supports distributed processing.</li>
<li><i>URI Hit Counter</i>.  An Interceptor
    with an appropriate <code>postService()</code> method could be utilized
    to capture hit count statistics for requested URIs, and store this
    information in some persistent storage location.</li>
<li><i>Web Server Style Access Log</i>.  When Tomcat is deployed in a stand
    alone environment with an HTTP communications adapter, it may be desireable
    to produce an access log file, in a format similar to that created by
    standard web servers such as Apache.  Such a log can be easily created by
    an Interceptor with the log file writing
    logic embedded in the <code>postService()</code> method.  You can have an
    access log per web application by attaching this Interceptor to the
    corresponding Context instance, or a combined
    log file by attaching it at either the Host or
    Engine level, with no changes to any of the
    Container implementation classes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.4 Example Component Implementations</h2>

<p>The following implementation examples are included with this proposal, to
illustrate the development approach that would normally be used:</p>

<i>In package <code>org.apache.tomcat.core</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>ContainerBase</b>.  Abstract base class that
    contains the logic common to all Container
    implementations.  This class can easily be subclassed to provide
    container-specific logic, because only the <code>getInfo()</code> and
    <code>service()</code> methods must be implemented (although additional
    methods may be overridden if necessary).</li>
<li><b>StandardContext</b>.  Example implementation of the Context interface.
    </li>
<li><b>StandardEngine</b>.  Example implementation of the Engine interface.
    </li>
<li><b>StandardHost</b>.  Example implementation of the Host interface.</li>
</ul>

<i>In package <code>org.apache.tomcat.logger</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>FileLogger</b>.  Implementation of Logger that writes to disk files
    in a specified directory, automatically switching to a new file at
    midnight each night.</li>
<li><b>SystemErrLogger</b>.  Implementation of Logger that writes to the
    System.err output stream.</li>
<li><b>SystemOutLogger</b>.  Implementation of Logger that writes to the
    System.out output stream.</li>
</ul>

<i>In package <code>org.apache.tomcat.security</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>SecurityInterceptor</b>.  Implementation of Interceptor that enforces
    the authentication and access control directives in the deployment
    descriptor of a web application.</li>
</ul>

<i>In package <code>org.apache.tomcat.session</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>StandardManager</b>.  Example implementation of Manager that provides
    the same session management capabilities as Tomcat 3.0.</li>
<li><b>StandardSession</b>.  Example implementation of Session that
    encapsulates an individual HttpSession within Tomcat.</li>
</ul>
