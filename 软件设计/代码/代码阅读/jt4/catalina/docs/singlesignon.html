<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In many large web sites, it is desireable to recognize an authenticated
user the first time that he or she tries to access a protected area in any
web application, and then recognize that authenticated user across other web
applications in the same environment without requiring the user to log in
again.  Tomcat supports that capability if it is configured as described
in this document.</p>

<a name="Requirements"></a>
<h3>Configuration Requirements</h3>

<p>To successfully configure Tomcat for "single sign on" support, the
following requirements must be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>All clients that intend to utilize "single sign on" support must provide
    support for cookies, which are used to maintain the user identity across
    web applications.</li>
<li>As implemented in Tomcat, the scope of "single sign on" support is
    the entire set of web applications registered with a single virtual host.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The system administrator must configure the
<code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml</code> file as follows to enable
"single sign on" support:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the <code>&lt;Engine&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Host&gt;</code> level,
    configure a <code>&lt;Realm&gt;</code> element that defines the database
    of valid users and their corresponding roles.  In the default configuration
    shipped with Tomcat, this is done at the Engine level.</li>
<li>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> configure a <code>&lt;Realm&gt;</code>
    element inside one of the <code>&lt;Context&gt;</code> elements describing
    the web applications associated with this virtual host.</li>
<li>Nested inside the <code>&lt;Host&gt;</code> element, you must include the
    following element:
    <pre>
        &lt;Valve class="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn"/&gt;
    </pre></li>
<li>Each web application that wishes to operate under the "single signon
    support" environment should define appropriate
    <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code> and
    <code>&lt;login-config&gt;</code> elements.  The former elements are used
    to identify portions of the application's URI space that are to require
    user authentication, and the latter element is used if this application
    is the first one accessed by the user that requires the user to log in.
    </li>
<li>There are no restrictions on different web applications utilizing
    different authentication methods.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Security"></a>
<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Because the "single signon support" implementation utilizes cookies to
maintain use identity across applications, the same risks of information
exposure apply here as when cookies are used to maintain session identity
within a single web application.  If you are concerned that attackers may
try to impersonate an ongoing session, you should run across a secure
network connection (such as an SSL connection using the <code>https</code>
protocol).</p>
