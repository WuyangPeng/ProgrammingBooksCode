<h1>4. SOURCE ORGANIZATION</h1>


<!-- 4.1 Directory -->
<a name="Directory"></a>
<h2>4.1 Directory Structure</h2>

<p>A key recommendation of this manual is to separate the directory
hierarchy containing your source code (described in this section) from
the directory hierarchy containing your deployable application
(described in the preceding section).  Maintaining this separation has
the following advantages:
<ul>
<li>The contents of the source directories can be more easily administered,
    moved, and backed up if the "executable" version of the application
    is not intermixed.
    <br><br>
<li>Source code control is easier to manage on directories that contain
    only source files.
    <br><br>
<li>The files that make up an installable distribution of your
    application are much easier to select when the deployment
    hierarchy is separate.
</ul>

<p>As we will see, the <code>ant</code> development tool makes the creation
and processing of such directory hierarchies nearly painless.

<p>The actual directory and file hierarchy used to contain the source code
of an application can be pretty much anything you like.  However, the
following organization has proven to be quite generally applicable, and is
expected by the example <code>build.xml</code> configuration file that
is discussed below.  All of these components exist under a top level
<i>project source directory</i> for your application:
<ul>
<li><b>etc/</b> - Directory containing special files related to your
    application that will be copied to the <code>WEB-INF</code> directory.
    In all cases, this will include the application deployment
    descriptor file (<code>web.xml</code>), but may include others as well.
    <br><br>
<li><b>lib/</b> - Directory containing JAR files that will be copied to
    the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> deployment directory.
    <br><br>
<li><b>src/</b> - Java source files that generate the servlets, beans,
    and other Java classes required by your application.  If your source
    code is organized into packages (highly recommended for large projects),
    the package hierarchy should be reflected as a directory structure
    underneath this directory.
    <br><br>
<li><b>web/</b> - Directory containing the HTML files, JSP pages, and other
    resource files (such as JavaScript and stylesheet files) that will be
    accessible to browser clients.  The entire hierarchy underneath this
    directory will be copied to the document root directory of your
    deployment home.
</ul>


<!-- 4.2 CVS -->
<a name="CVS"></a>
<h2>4.2 Source Code Control</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, it is highly recommended that you place all of the
source files that comprise your application under the management of a
source code control system like the Concurrent Version System (CVS).  If you
elect to do this, every directory and file in the source hierarchy should be
registered and saved -- but none of the generated files.  If you register
binary format files (such as images or JAR libraries), be sure to indicate
this to your source code control system.

<p>Detailed instructions for your source code control environment are beyond
the scope of this manual.  However, the following steps are followed when
using a command-line CVS client:
<ul>
<li>To refresh the state of your source code to that stored in the
    the source repository, go to your project source directory, and
    execute <code>cvs update -d</code>.
    <br><br>
<li>When you create a new subdirectory in the source code hierarchy, register
    it in CVS with a command like <code>cvs add {subdirname}</code>.
    <br><br>
<li>When you first create a new source code file, navigate to the directory
    that contains it, and register the new file with a command like
    <code>cvs add {filename}</code>.
    <br><br>
<li>If you no longer need a particular source code file, navigate to the
    containing directory and remove the file.  Then, deregister it in CVS
    with a command like <code>cvs remove {filename}</code>.
    <br><br>
<li>While you are creating, modifying, and deleting source files, changes
    are not yet reflected in the server repository.  To save your changes in
    their current state, go to the project source directory
    and execute <code>cvs commit</code>.  You will be asked to write a brief
    description of the changes you have just completed, which will be stored
    with the new version of any updated source file.
</ul>

<p>CVS, like other source code control systems, has many additional features
(such as the ability to tag the files that made up a particular release, and
support for multiple development branches that can later be merged).  See the
links and references in the <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> for
more information.


<!-- 4.3 Build -->
<a name="Build"></a>
<h2>4.3 BUILD.XML Configuration File</h2>

<p>We will be using the <code>ant</code> tool to manage the compilation of
our Java source code files, and creation of the deployment hierarchy.  Ant
operates under the control of a build file, normally called
<code>build.xml</code>, that defines the processing steps required.  Like a
Makefile, the <code>build.xml</code> file provides several "targets" that
support optional development activities (such as creating the associated
Javadoc documentation, erasing the deployment home directory so you can build
your project from scratch, or creating the web application archive file so
you can distribute your application.

<p>To give you a head start, a
<a href="build.xml.txt" target="_new">basic build.xml file</a> is provided
that you can customize and install in the project source directory for your
application.  This file includes comments that describe the various
targets that can be executed.  Briefly, the following targets are generally
provided:
<ul>
<li><b>prepare</b> - This target "prepares" the deployment directory,
    creating subdirectories as required.  A common use of this target is
    to copy static files (documentation, HTML pages, and JSP pages)
    from the source directory to the deployment directory.  When
    executed, this target will only create directories if they do not
    exist, and only copy files if the destination file does not exist,
    or the source version of the file is newer.  This target is generally
    invoked indirectly, by virtue of a <code>depends</code> attribute on
    some other task.
<li><b>compile</b> - This target is used to compile any source code that
    has been changed since the last time compilation took place.  The
    resulting class files are created in the deployment directory, so
    that they can be directly executed when Tomcat is run.
    <strong>NOTE</strong> - Previous versions of Ant copied properties files
    and other resource files for you as part of the execution of the
    <code>&lt;javac&gt;</code> task.  You must now do this explicitly.
<li><b>javadoc</b> - This target creates Javadoc API documentation for the
    Java classes in this web application.  The example <code>build.xml</code>
    file assumes you want to include the API documentation with your app,
    so it generates the docs in a subdirectory of the deployment directory.
<li><b>all</b> - This target deletes the entire deployment directory and
    then recreates everything.  It is a good habit to do this after you've
    made a bunch of changes, and before you check them in to your source
    code repository.  In particular, you should perform <code>build all</code>
    before you use the "dist" target to create a distribution of your
    application, to ensure that the distribution contains no unwanted files.
<li><b>dist</b> - This target creates a web application archive (WAR) file
    containing your application, and a JAR file containing all of the
    source code.  In the example <code>build.xml</code> file, the contents
    of the WAR file are based on the most recent build in the deployment
    directory.
</ul>

<p>In the following section, scripts will be described that use Ant to
compile your project, based on the contents of the <code>build.xml</code>
file defined here.


<!-- 4.4 Scripts -->
<a name="Scripts"</a>
<h2>4.4 Shell and Batch Scripts</h2>

<p>The primary script we will utilize is generically called the <i>build</i>
script.  It executes Ant, which reads and processes the <code>build.xml</code>
file discussed above.  Each time you execute the build script, you will
specify the build "target" that you wish to execute.  Users of a command
line MAKE tool (which processes a makefile) will recognize this approach.

<p>On UNIX-based systems, the following script should be saved as file
<code>build.sh</code> in the project source directory, with file permissions
that make it executable, and customized as required:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# build -- Build Script for the "Hello, World" Application
# $Id: source.html,v 1.2 2001/08/14 18:50:09 pier Exp $

# Identify the custom class path components we need
CP=$CATALINA_HOME/lib/ant.jar:$CATALINA_HOME/lib/servlet.jar
CP=$CP:$CATALINA_HOME/lib/jaxp.jar:$CATALINA_HOME/lib/parser.jar
CP=$CP:$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar

# Execute ANT to perform the requested build target
java -classpath $CP:$CLASSPATH org.apache.tools.ant.Main \
  -Dtomcat.home=$CATALINA_HOME "$@"
</pre>

<p>On Windows-based systems, the following script should be saved as file
<code>build.bat</code> in the project source directory, and customized
as required:

<pre>
@echo off
rem build.bat -- Build Script for the "Hello, World" Application
rem $Id: source.html,v 1.2 2001/08/14 18:50:09 pier Exp $

set _CP=%CP%

rem Identify the custom class path components we need
set CP=%CATALINA_HOME%\lib\ant.jar;%CATALINA_HOME%\lib\servlet.jar
set CP=%CATALINA_HOME%\lib\jaxp.jar;%CATALINA_HOME%\lib\parser.jar
set CP=%CP%;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar

rem Execute ANT to perform the requird build target
java -classpath %CP%;%CLASSPATH% org.apache.tools.ant.Main -Dtomcat.home=%CATALINA_HOME% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

set CP=%_CP%
set _CP=
</pre>

<p>Build script customizations you might consider include:
<ul>
<li>Setting the JAVA_HOME and CATALINA_HOME environment variables (probably
    near the top of the script) if they are not defined already.
    <br><br>
<li>Overriding properties defined in the <code>build.xml</code> file
    with default values.  For example, to change the distribution home
    directory (property <code>dist.home</code>), you would include the
    following command line option after the word "java":
    <b>-Ddist.home=xxxxx</b>.
    <br><br>
</ul>
