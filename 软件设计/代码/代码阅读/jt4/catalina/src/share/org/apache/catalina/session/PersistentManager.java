 *
 * <li>Persist sessions across restarts of the Container</li>
 * <li>Fault tolerance, keep sessions backed up on disk to allow
 *     recovery in the event of unplanned restarts.</li>
 * <li>Limit the number of active sessions kept in memory by
 *     swapping less active sessions out to disk.</li>
