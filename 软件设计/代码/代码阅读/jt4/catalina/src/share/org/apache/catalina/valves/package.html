<p>This package contains a variety of small Valve implementations that do
not warrant being packaged separately.  In addition, there is a convenience
base class (<code>ValveBase</code>) that supports the usual mechanisms for
including custom Valves into the corresponding Pipeline.</p>

<p>Other packages that include Valves include
<code>org.apache.tomcat.logger</code> and
<code>org.apache.tomcat.security</code>.</p>
