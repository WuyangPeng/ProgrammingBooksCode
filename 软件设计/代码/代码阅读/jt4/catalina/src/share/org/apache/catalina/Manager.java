/**
 * A <b>Manager</b> manages the pool of Sessions that are associated with a
 * particular Container.  Different Manager implementations may support
 * value-added features such as the persistent storage of session data,
 * as well as migrating sessions for distributable web applications.
 * <p>
 * In order for a <code>Manager</code> implementation to successfully operate
 * with a <code>Context</code> implementation that implements reloading, it
 * must obey the following constraints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Must implement <code>Lifecycle</code> so that the Context can indicate
 *     that a restart is required.
 * <li>Must allow a call to <code>stop()</code> to be followed by a call to
 *     <code>start()</code> on the same <code>Manager</code> instance.
 * </ul>
