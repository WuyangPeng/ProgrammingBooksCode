/**
 * A <b>Server</b> represents one convenient way to package a set of
 * <code>Connectors</code> associated with a particular <code>Container</code>.
 * You can have several many-to-one relationships (set of Connectors associated
 * with one Container) by adding one or more Connectors first, followed by the
 * corresponding Container, and then repeating this pattern.
 * <p>
 * This interface (and the corresonding implementation) exist to simplify
 * configuring Catalina from a <code>server.xml</code> file.  It has no
 * functional role once the server has been started.
 * <p>
 * Normally, an implementation of this interface will also implement
 * <code>Lifecycle</code>, such that when the <code>start()</code> and
 * <code>stop()</code> methods are called, all of the defined Containers
 * and Connectors are also started or stopped.
 * <p>
 * In between, the implementation must open a server socket on the port number
 * specified by the <code>port</code> property.  When a connection is accepted,
 * the first line is read and compared with the specified shutdown command.
 * If the command matches, shutdown of the server is initiated.
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE</strong> - The concrete implementation of this class should
 * register the (singleton) instance with the <code>ServerFactory</code>
 * class in its constructor(s).
