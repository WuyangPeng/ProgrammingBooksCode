<p>This package contains Java objects that represent complex data structures
from the web application deployment descriptor file (<code>web.xml</code>).
It is assumed that these objects will be initialized within the context of
a single thread, and then referenced in a read-only manner subsequent to that
time.  Therefore, no multi-thread synchronization is utilized within the
implementation classes.</p>
