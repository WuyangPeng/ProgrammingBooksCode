<section name="Development Processes">

<p>Although application development can take many forms, this manual proposes
a fairly generic process for creating web applications using Tomcat.  The
following sections highlight the commands and tasks that you, as the developer
of the code, will perform.  The same basic approach works when you have
multiple programmers involved, as long as you have an appropriate source code
control system and internal team rules about who is working on what parts
of the application at any given time.</p>

<p>The task descriptions below assume that you will be using CVS for source
code control, and that you have already configured access to the appropriate
CVS repository.  Instructions for doing this are beyond the scope of this
manual.  If you are using a different source code control environment, you
will need to figure out the corresponding commands for your system.</p>


<subsection name="Create Project Source Code Directory">

<p>The first step is to create a new project source directory, and customize
the <code>build.xml</code> and build script you will be using.  The directory
structure is described in <a href="source.html">the previous section</a>,
or you can use the <a href="sample">sample application</a> as a starting
point.</p>

<p>Create your project source directory, and define it within your CVS
repository.  This might be done by a series of commands like this, where
<code>{project}</code> is the name under which your project should be
stored in the CVS repository, and {username} is your login username:</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
mkdir myapp	&lt;-- Assumed "project source directory"
cd myapp
mkdir docs
mkdir src
mkdir web
mkdir web/WEB-INF
cvs import -m "Initial Project Creation" {project} \
	{username} start
</source>

<p>Now, to verify that it was created correctly in CVS, we will perform a
checkout of the new project:</p>
<source>
cd ..
mv myapp myapp.bu
cvs checkout {project}
</source>

<p>Next, you will need to create and check in an initial version of the
<code>build.xml</code> script to be used for development.  For getting
started quickly and easily, base your <code>build.xml</code> on the
<a href="build.xml.txt">basic build.xml file</a>, included with this manual,
or code it from scratch.</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp
emacs build.xml		&lt;-- if you want a real editor :-)
cvs add build.xml
cvs commit
</source>

<p>Until you perform the CVS commit, your changes are local to your own
development directory.  Committing makes those changes visible to other
developers on your team that are sharing the same CVS repository.</p>

<p>Now, create the initial version of the web application deployment
descriptor.  You can base <code>web.xml</code> on the
<a href="web.xml.txt">basic web.xml file</a>, or code it from scratch.</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp/WEB-INF
emacs web.xml
cvs add web.xml
cvs commit
</source>

</subsection>


<subsection name="Customize for Tomcat Location">

<p>In order for Tomcat to recognize your application, you must deploy it
as described under <a href="deployment.html">Deployment</a>.  Any of the
proposed techniques can be used.  For our purposes, we will assume that
you are using the <em>unpacked directory hierarchy</em> approach, and a
<code>build.xml</code> script based on the example included with this manual.
</p>

<p>In order to successfully execute the <code>deploy</code> target, you
must ensure that the <code>catalina.home</code> property receives the
correct value, which must be the pathname of the directory into which you
have installed Tomcat 4.  You can make this customization by one of the
following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the property definition in the <code>build.xml</code> file so
    that it reflects the Tomcat 4 location.  The modified property setting
    might look like this:
<source>
&lt;property name="catalina.home" value="/usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-4.0"/&gt;
</source></li>
<li>Set up a <code>build.properties</code> file in your top-level source
    directory that defines the location oF Tomcat.  For example, the file
    might contain:
<source>
catalina.home=/usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-4.0
</source></li>
</ul>

<p>The first technique would be appropriate if all of your developers are
sharing a common copy of Tomcat 4 for their deployment and testing.  If,
however, each developer is using their own copy of Tomcat 4, in separate
directories, the latter technique is preferred (because it lets each
developer define their own value for the <code>catalina.home</code>
property.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - If you utilize the <code>build.properties</code>
approach, be sure that you do <strong>NOT</strong> check in the
<code>build.properties</code> file for any of your developers in to the
source code archives.  For this reason, the <code>.cvsignore</code> file
you created earlier should include this filename.</p>

</subsection>


<subsection name="Edit Source Code and Pages">

<p>The edit/build/test tasks will generally be your most common activities
during development and maintenance.  The following general principles apply.
As described in <a href="source.html">Source Organization</a>, newly created
source files should be located in the appropriate subdirectory, under your
project source directory.</p>

<p>Whenever you wish to refresh your development directory to reflect the
work performed by other developers, you will ask CVS to do it for you:</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp
cvs update -dP
</source>

<p>To create a new file, go to the appropriate directory, create the file,
and register it with CVS.  When you are satisfied with it's contents (after
building and testing is successful), commit the new file to the repository.
For example, to create a new JSP page:</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp/web		&lt;-- Ultimate destination is document root
emacs mypage.jsp
cvs add mypage.jsp
... build and test the application ...
cvs commit
</source>

<p>Java source code that is defined in packages must be organized in a
directory hierarchy (under the <strong>src/</strong> subdirectory) that
matches the package names.  For example, a Java class named
<code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyClass.java</code> should be stored in file
<code>src/com/mycompany/mypackage/MyClass.java</code>.
Whenever you create a new subdirectory, don't forget to
register it with CVS.</p>

<p>To edit an existing source file, you will generally just start editing
and testing, then commit the changed file when everything works.  Although
CVS can be configured to required you to "check out" or "lock" a file you
are going to be modifying, this is generally not used.</p>

</subsection>


<subsection name="Build the Web Application">

<p>When you are ready to compile the application, issue the following
commands (generally, you will want a shell window open that is set to
the project source directory, so that only the last command is needed):</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp		&lt;-- Normally leave a window open here
ant
</source>

<p>The Ant tool will be execute the default "compile" target in your
<code>build.xml</code> file, which will compile any new or updated Java
code.  If this is the first time you compile after a "build clean",
it will cause everything to be recompiled.</p>

<p>To force the recompilation of your entire application, do this instead:</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp
ant all
</source>

<p>This is a very good habit immediately before checking in changes, to
make sure that you have not introduced any subtle problems that Javac's
conditional checking did not catch.</p>

</subsection>


<subsection name="Test Your Web Application">

<p>To test your application, you will want to deploy it under Tomcat.  If you
have customized the <code>catalina.home</code> property as described above,
this is very easy.  First, deploy the application into Tomcat:</p>
<source>
cd {my home directory}
cd myapp
ant deploy
</source>

<p>and then restart Tomcat.  To access your application, point your
browser at <code>http://localhost:8080/myapp/</code> and begin testing.
When you discover something that needs to change, fix it in
the source directory (not in the Tomcat deployment directory), redeploy,
and restart Tomcat.</p>

<p>Do not forget to commit your changes to the source code repository when
you have completed your testing!</p>

</subsection>


<subsection name="Creating a Release">

<p>When you are through adding new functionality, and you've tested everything
(you DO test, don't you :-), it is time to create the distributable version
of your web application that can be deployed on the production server.  The
following general steps are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue the command <code>ant all</code> from the project source
    directory, to rebuild everything from scratch one last time.
    <br/><br/></li>
<li>Use the <code>cvs tag</code> command to create an identifier for
    all of the source files utilized to create this release.  This allows
    you to reliably reconstruct a release (from sources) at a later
    time.</li>
<li>Issue the command <code>ant dist</code> to create a distributable
    web application archive (WAR) file, as well as a JAR file containing
    the corresponding source code.
    <br/><br/></li>
<li>Package the contents of the <code>dist</code> directory using the
    <strong>tar</strong> or <strong>zip</strong> utility, according to
    the standard release procedures used by your organization.</li>
</ul>
