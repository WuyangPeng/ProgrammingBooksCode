   <title>Modifications to support IterationTag in JSP</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>IterationTag support</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Classes Modified</h2>

<h3>TagBeginGenerator</h3>
<ul>
<li>The return value of doStartTag() is now checked against EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED
  instead of EVAL_BODY_TAG.
  EVAL_BODY_TAG is deprecated, and both have the same integer value 
  so we only check against EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED.
</ul>

<h3>TagEndGenerator</h3>
<ul>
<li>doAfterBody() is now called if tag is an instance of IteratorTag (instead
  of if it is an instance of BodyTag)

<li>The return value of doAfterBody() is now checked against EVAL_BODY_AGAIN
  instead of EVAL_BODY_TAG.
  EVAL_BODY_TAG is deprecated, and both have the same integer value 
  so we only check against EVAL_BODY_AGAIN.
</ul>
