<h2>
What is Jasper?</h2>
Jasper is the reference implementation of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JSP
specification</a>. It is packaged in Tomcat along with Catalina (the reference
implementation of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet specification</a>). <p>
It is a goal to have Jasper as a component that is independent of Catalina (and vice-versa). We're currently working on this.

<h2>Status</h2>
The Jasper code base is going through a substantial reorganization 
following the evolution of tomcat-3.x to tomcat-4.0. Tomcat-4.0 is the first release  to support the new 
Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications.
