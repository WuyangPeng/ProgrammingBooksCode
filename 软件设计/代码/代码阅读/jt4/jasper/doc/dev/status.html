<li>2000/08/30
<br>In an effort to bootstrap the work required to bring Jasper in compliance 
with the new JSP 1.2 spec (according to the guidelines proposed by Craig 
in a previous posting), new developer documentation was committed to the 
workspace to help us all be in sync with the current efforts, and what
needs to be done. Check the <a href="README.html">README</a>.<p>

<li>2000/08/25<br>
One of the goals of the new architecture of Jasper is to be independent of the servlet engine. This is why jasper now stands in its own directory in tomcat-4.0. It currently works with Catalina, with only a few dependencies, which we will work on removing. Please check the document <a href="jasper-independent.html">Jasper as an Independent Component</a> for the story.
