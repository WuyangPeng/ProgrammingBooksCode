A few documentation files in the directories cocoon/docs and demogl/docs
have names longer than the 64 characters permitted by the Joliet CD-ROM
extensions and have therefore had their names truncated.

The files cocoon/docs.tar.gz and demogl/docs.tar.gz contain the original
contents of these directories.  You can unpack them in a separate
directory to obtain the full file names.
