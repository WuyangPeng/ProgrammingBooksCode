Copyright (C) 1992-1996 Gnanasekaran Swaminathan <gs4t@virginia.edu>

Permission is granted to use at your own risk and distribute this software
in source and  binary forms provided  the above copyright notice and  this
paragraph are  preserved on all copies.  This software is provided "as is"
with no express or implied warranty.

Installation Note:
-----------------
This software has been tested in sun4 running SunOs4.1.3 machine only.
If you are having problems with any aspect of socket++, please
email me at gs4t@virginia.edu. We can fix it together.

This software works with proposed C++ standard iostream library. Thus
if you are using libg++, you need at least libg++-2.7.2.

Your C++ compiler should be able to handle C++ exceptions and templates.
Thus if you are using G++, you need at least gcc-2.7.2.

socket++.texi needs at least texinfo-2.16.

Gcc, libg++, and texinfo are all available for anonymous ftp from
	prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu

	cd socket++-1.11
	env CCC=c++ ./configure --prefix="your favorite location"
	make           
	cd test
	make check     

If you are using a compiler that is invoked by a command other than c++, 
use that command instead on CCC=c++ in the above.

Testing:
-------
make check will automatically run testall.

You can also manually test as follows:
	./testall > testall.out
	diff -c testall.out testall.exp
If there are any differences, manually check whether 
testall.out and testall.exp have the same lines but only their
order is different. If they have the same lines but
for the order, you have installed properly. Otherwise,
try to findout what might be the reason and if you couldn't
please email me with your problem at gs4t@virginia.edu.

Bug reports:
-----------
Send them to me at gs4t@virginia.edu

to compile under Objectcenter C++ compiler.

Solaris support is still weak, and thus the names
of people who helped to port to solaris is not listed
here yet.

and a number of bug fixes.

Enjoy!
