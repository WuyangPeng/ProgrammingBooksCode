Welcome to ArgoUML!

In case you just downloaded and unzipped your ArgoUML distribution, here's how to proceed:

First, you need Java2 installed, get it from http://java.sun.com" for your platform. Any Java2 JDK or JRE should work, although with Java JRE/JDK 1.3 there are some minor problems.

Now (after unpacking the distro, which you obvioulsy have done, because this file was in it), you should have a bunch of .jar files (argouml.jar, nsuml.jar and others...) in your directory, please do NOT unpack these. Just leave them as jar files.

At last you can just start the argouml.jar, on Windows platforms by double-clicking it, on other platforms by typing

java -jar argouml.jar

on a command line in the appropriate directory. Note that you need all jar files in this directory. That's it, ArgoUML should start up now. If not, please consider asking on the users mailing list at users@argouml.tigris.org, subscribe by sending a mail to users-subscribe@argouml.tigris.org.

Have fun!
