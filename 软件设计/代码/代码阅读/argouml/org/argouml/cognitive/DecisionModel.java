/** The DecisionModel is part of the state of the Designer.  It
 *  describes what types of decisions, or design issues, the Designer
 *  is thinking about at the current time.  Critics that are relevant to
 *  those decisions are made active, Critics that are not relevant are
 *  made inactive.
 *
 *  Needs-More-Work: There is some notion that each decision has a
 *  certain importanance at a certain time, but I have not followed
 *  through on that because I don't have good examples of how to
 *  quantify the importance of a decision.
 *
 *  Needs-More-Work: Right now the individual decisions are just
 *  Strings, maybe they should have some non-atomic structure? */
