/** This class defines an item that can be placed on a Checklist.
 *  This is a short piece of text to prompt the designer to think of a
 *  specific design issue.  CheckItems are similiar to critics in that
 *  they are categorized to be releavant to issues the designer is
 *  interested in, they have a guarding condition that returns true if
 *  the CheckItem should be presented, and they have a piece of text
 *  as design feedback. They are different in that their predicate is
 *  almost always the constant 'true', and the feedback they provide
 *  is much simpler.
 *
 * CheckItems are part of Checklists.  And Checklists are registered
 * with the CheckManager.
 *
 *  If you have a piece of advice you would like to give a designer,
 *  you can implement it as a CheckItem _very_ easily.  If you can
 *  formalize the advice more, you can implement it as a Critic.
 *
