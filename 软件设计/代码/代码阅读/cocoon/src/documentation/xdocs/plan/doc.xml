 <s1 title="Overview">

  <p>Of course, the Cocoon documentation is always undergoing evolution.
   These notes remind us of some things that have been discussed and not
   yet implemented.
  </p>

  <p>The following sections list some documents that need revision and some
   required additional documents. At the bottom is a list of general issues.
  </p>

 </s1>

 <s1 title="Revisions required">

  <ul>
   <li>Announcement (announcement.xml)
    <ul>
     <li>Needs to be more positive</li>
     <li>Needs a concise overview of Cocoon (which can be re-used on the home page)</li>
     </ul>
   </li>

   <li>The home page (index.xml)
    <ul>
     <li>needs to be more positive</li>

     </ul>
   </li>

   <li>Frequently Asked Questions
    <ul>
     <li>Needs re-structure or we will have the same un-wieldy monster FAQ as

     </li>
     </ul>
   </li>

  </ul>
 </s1>

 <s1 title="Fix the placeholder documents">

  <p>
   These pages have a shell, but no content yet. They currently have the
   embarrassing &quot;Under Construction&quot; type of notice.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Index pages for &quot;Developing&quot; and &quot;Userdocs&quot;</li>
   <li>userdocs/actions/actions.xml</li>
<!--
   <li>
    <ul>
     <li>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </li>
-->

  </ul>
 </s1>

 <s1 title="Additional documents required">

  <ul>
   <li></li>
<!--
   <li>
    <ul>
     <li>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </li>
-->

  </ul>

 </s1>

 <s1 title="General Issues">

  <p>Certain issues need to be addressed for all current and future
   documentation.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Many pages use source elements to list code or configuration information.
    Wide pre-formatted text lines do not word-wrap in HTML output and so the
    user would need to painfully scroll left-and-right to read the page.
   </li>

   <li>All documentation needs to be continually revised. It cannot be written
    and then never updated. It needs to keep in step with the code and
    configuration changes.
   </li>
  </ul>
