 <s1 title="Introduction">

  <p>
   This is an <strong>informal</strong> list - in chronological order -
   of some of the noteworthy patches that have been posted
   to the <link href="mailto:cocoon-dev@xml.apache.org">cocoon-dev</link> mailing list.
   These patches are not (yet) part of the Apache Cocoon project, but need reviewing for possible
   inclusion. This system was instituted because, due to the large volume of mail and
   the lack of time of the committers, some patches tended to get forgotten about. This
   queue does not guarantee that any patch will be reviewed within a reasonable time frame,
   but it does at least make them easier to find!
  </p>

  <p><strong>Reviewers wanted!</strong> - If you have time to review and/or test these patches,
   we would be grateful for your time. Please post comments to the cocoon-dev mailing lists.
  </p>

  <p>
   Before submitting a patch, please read the page on <connect href="contrib.xml">Third-Party
   Contributions</connect>. The preferred submission method for patches is:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Post to cocoon-dev@xml.apache.org</li>
   <li>Describe the patch, the reason for it and (if necessary) why this is important.</li>
   <li>Generate the patch in <code>diff -u</code> format from CVS</li>
   <li>Also generate a documentation patch or new file, if this is something that should be documented.
   </li>
   <li>Post as an attachment rather than inline (unless it is trivially small).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Following the above guidelines will facilitate your patch being reviewed
   and applied efficiently.</p>
