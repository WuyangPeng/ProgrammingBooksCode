/**
*translates the Win32 key code into an actually usable 
*structure.
*Specifies the repeat count, scan code, extended-key flag, context code, previous key-state flag, 
*and transition-state flag, as shown in the following table. 
*Value Description 
*	0–15 Specifies the repeat count for the current message. 
*	     The value is the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated 
*		 as a result of the user holding down the key. If the keystroke is held 
*		 long enough, multiple messages are sent. However, the repeat count is not cumulative. 
*
*	16–23 Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). 
*
*	24   Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that 
*	     appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; 
*		 otherwise, it is 0. 
*
*	25–28 Reserved; do not use. 
*
*	29   Specifies the context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the 
*        key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0. 
*
*	30   Specifies the previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before
*        the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up. 
*	31   Specifies the transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released, or it 
*	     is 0 if the key is being pressed.
