This device-independent color name database is provided just as an example.
There are no claims that these color specifications are or should be bound
to the corresponding color name.

As you can see, the start of the database is indicated by "XCMS_COLORDB_START".
Anything before this is assumed to be comments.  The "0.1" indicates the
version number of the format/syntax used in this file.  The color name is
delimited from the color specification by one or more tabs.
