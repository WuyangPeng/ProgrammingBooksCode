		       Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3


			   The XFree86 Project, Inc


				  30 May 1997



				   Abstract

     This document describes the new features in XFree86 3.3 compared with
     the previous full release, 3.2.  It also includes installation
     instructions for the binary distributions.



1.  XFree86 and X11R6.3

XFree86 releases starting with the 3.2A beta are based on the X Consortium's
X11R6.3 (the final release from the X Consortium).

R6.3 is an update to R6.1, and is intended to be compatible with R6.1 and R6 at
the source and protocol levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.	X11R6.3
includes some new Xserver extensions: SECURITY, XC-APPGROUP, XpExtension (print
extension), and an updated, and standardised version of LBX.  X11R6.3 also has
new standards, including RX (X Remote Execution MIME type), and a proxy manage-
ment protocol.	X11R6.3 includes support for gzipped fonts.

R6.1 is an update to R6, and is intended to be compatible with R6 at the source
and protocol levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.  X11R6.1 includes
some new Xserver extensions: DOUBLE-BUFFER, XKEYBOARD and RECORD.

What about R6.2?  X11R6.2 is the name given to a subset of X11R6.3, which has
only the print extension and the Xlib implementation of vertical writing and
user-defined character support in addition to those features included in R6.1.


2.  OS issues

Always check the OS specific README files for special requirements or caveats.

Users running Linux/Elf (on Intel platforms) should note that they will need
ld.so version 1.7.14 or later.	This can be found at
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC.

Note: Elf is now the only binary type supported for Linux OSs.	This means that
binaries for ix86/a.out and AXP/ECOFF are not available with this release.

3.  New Features in 3.3

3.1  General

   o XFree86 3.3 includes the X Consortium's X11R6.3.

3.2  General X server changes

   o The X servers include a new DPMS extension, which was donated by Digital
     Equipment Corporation.  Not all DPMS modes have been implemented by all
     servers yet, but this should improve in future releases.  See the XF86Con-
     fig(4/5) and xset(1) man pages for further details.

   o The LBX extension is included in all the X servers, as part of the update
     to R6.3.

   o A print-only server (Xprt) is included as part of the update to R6.3.

   o Some bugs in the Type1 font code have been fixed.

   o Some bugs in newer functions in the XFree86 VidMode extension have been
     fixed.

   o Support has been added for the Microsoft IntelliMouse.

3.3  XF86Setup

   o Some bugs have been fixed, but no major changes have been made to this
     version.

   o More modelines were added. There are now high-refresh versions of most
     common modes available (85 and 100 Hz). 512x384, 1152x864, 1600x1200 and
     1800x1440 modes were added.

3.4  PC98 Support

   o The XF98_TGUI server includes XAA support, but there are some problems
     with this at the moment.  It can be disabled with the "noaccel" option.

3.5  Alpha (AXP) platform support

   o Support for the S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX is now available.

   o Support for "newmmio" is now available for the S3 868/968/Trio64V+ and is
     enabled by default (use chipset "mmio_928" to get the old behaviour).

   o Support for the Matrox Millennium and Mystique (in the SVGA server) is
     included.

   o Support for the Trident driver (in the SVGA server) is included.

   o Some problems that showed up with Netscape on some servers have been
     fixed.









Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



   o Various alignment problems have been fixed.

   o NOTE: A recent Linux kernel version is required for most of these servers
     (essential for the Matrox driver).

   o Scanpci now works on Alpha platforms.

3.6  XInput Extension

   o Multiple input devices can share the core pointer.

3.6.1  Wacom driver

   o Multiple devices can be defined for the same tablet to represent different
     active zones.

3.7  XKEYBOARD Extension

   o An improved layout for Russian keyboards is provided.

   o A layout for Hungarian keyboards is provided.

3.8  SVGA server

   o A new general graphics acceleration interface (XFree86 Acceleration Archi-
     tecture - XAA) has been implemented.  It is used to provide relatively
     complete acceleration, at different colour depths, for several chips in
     the SVGA server.  Chips currently making use of this include the Matrox
     Millennium, Mystique, Tseng ET4000/W32p and ET6000, and several chips from
     ARK Logic, Chips and Technologies, Cirrus, Trident, SiS and the S3 ViRGE
     family.

   o The SVGA server now includes a driver for the S3 ViRGE family. It supports
     the ViRGE, ViRGE/DX, ViRGE/GX and ViRGE/VX. This driver is a completely
     new implementation, so please send in success/failure reports.

3.9  S3 server

   o Some further S3 968 hardware bugs for lines/text have been worked around.

   o Cursor/pointer pixmaps larger than 64x64 are now supported without the
     need to use the "sw_cursor" option.

   o Detection/support for the Trio64UV+, Trio64V2 (including the /DX and /GX
     versions), Aurora64V+ (86CM65 used in notebooks), and Plato/PX is now
     included.	This support is very new and hasn't had much testing, so please
     send us success/failure reports.

   o Support is now included for the ELSA Winner 2000PRO/X-8.  Please refer to
     the notes for this card in README.S3.

   o Support is now included for the MIRO 80SV.










Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



   o A bug which prevented DGA apps from setting the ViewPort to the lower part
     of the framebuffer has been fixed (this showed up most commonly with 4MB
     cards).

3.10  S3V (ViRGE) server

   o Support has been added for the ViRGE/DX and ViRGE/GX.

   o Problems with the Diamond Stealth 3D 3000 are now fixed.

   o The line drawing code has been improved.

   o Packed 24bpp support is included, and should be improved over earlier ver-
     sions.

   o The S3V server translates between sparse 32bpp pixmaps and packed 24bpp
     for the framebuffer.  In some cases this can be slow.

   o 32bpp framebuffer format is not supported.

3.11  Mach64 server

   o Support for 3D Rage II based Mach64 cards is included.

   o Various problems with support for some revisions of CT, VT and GT chipsets
     have been fixed.

   o It is strongly recommended that all users with CT, VT, GT and 3D Rage II
     based Mach64 cards upgrade to the 3.3 release due to the problems that
     were fixed.

3.12  Mach32 server

   o A bug that causes problems when running XF86Setup with cards with less
     than 2MB of video memory has been fixed.

   o Minor shifts in maximum clock rate under 16 bpp, and inclusion of explicit
     15 "bpp" setting.

3.13  W32 server

   o In this version, the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not undergone any
     significant changes. In fact, it is not being developed further. Instead,
     the SVGA server (XF86_SVGA) is now the main focus of new developments. See
     the W32 (SVGA) description.

3.14  P9000 server

   o Support for PCI probing has been added.

   o DPMS support has been added.











Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



3.15  I128 server

   o Some preliminary acceleration (for bitblts) is included.  This code is
     very new, and hasn't been extensively tested yet.

3.16  TGA server

   o Preliminary acceleration support is included, using XAA.

   o Various bugs have been fixed.

3.17  Trident driver (SVGA server)

   o Acceleration support has been added for the 9320, 9440 and 96xx chips.

   o Support for the Cyber series of laptop chips has been improved.

   o 24/32bpp support has been added for some chips.

   o Some clock limits have been fixed.

3.18  Ark driver (SVGA server)

   o More complete acceleration has been implemented using XAA, including line
     draw, fill, and text acceleration, at different colour depths.

3.19  W32 driver (SVGA server)

   o The SVGA server now supports acceleration for the most recent ET4000W32
     chips. In 3.3, the ET4000W32p chips are now fully accelerated, and also
     support the higher performing linear memory layout (read the tseng README
     file for more information: there are a few problems).

   o VESA DPMS (monitor power saving) support was added.

   o There is now support for more than 256 colors on most ET4000W32i and
     ET4000W32p chips. This means 15, 16, 24 and/or 32 bits per pixel modes
     (32768, 65536 or 16 million colors) are supported on most common RAMDACs.
     On the W32p, these modes are accelerated. On the W32i, there is no accel-
     eration in any mode. For accelerated support on W32i chips, refer to the
     separate W32 server (XF86_W32).

   o A few bugs in XFree86 3.2 and 3.2A have been fixed. Most importantly the
     failure to probe some PCI cards has been resolved.

   o Fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards, floppy-tape
     drives)

   o Support for the Chrontel RAMDAC has been added.

3.20  ET6000 driver (SVGA server)

   o The ET6000 driver in the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not changed
     significantly.








Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



   o On the other hand, the ET6000 driver in the SVGA server, which already
     existed in XFree86 3.2 for all color depths, is now fully accelerated for
     all those color depths. It builds upon the new XAA architecture, which is
     the cornerstone of a new acceleration framework within the XFree86
     servers. It is responsible for the outstanding acceleration performance of
     this release.

   o Many small problems which existed in the initial 3.2 release have been
     solved. Screen noise, flicker or instability at higher pixel clocks are
     mostly fixed. Some detection problems are gone. Weird behaviour (jumping
     and screen wrap) when panning through large virtual desktops has been
     fixed. The server now detects the correct amount of memory on ET6000 cards
     with 2.25 MB of MDRAM. More realistic pixel clock rate limits have been
     put in place, to avoid modes that would cause screen problems.

   o DPMS support was added.

   o The ET6000 hardware cursor is now supported. Read the Tseng documentation
     file for more information (there are a few limitations)

   o fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards, floppy-tape
     drives)

3.21  Alliance ProMotion driver (SVGA server)

   o The driver now recognises the AT24 chipset, but it is treated the same way
     as the AP6422.

3.22  Matrox driver (SVGA server)

   o More complete acceleration for the Millennium (MGA2064W).

   o Support is included for the Mystique (including some acceleration).  This
     code is very new.

   o 24 bpp mode tiled pattern problems still present.

   o Support for DGA, Sync-on-Green, and DPMS.

   o The "nolinear" option is no longer available.

   o Support for 8 bits per colour component (at 8bpp) has been added.

3.23  Cirrus driver (SVGA server)

   o More complete acceleration for all chips with a BitBLT engine (CL-GD5426,
     5428, 5429, 5430, 5434, 5436, 5440, 5446, 7541, 7543, and 7548).

   o More complete acceleration for Laguna series chips (CL-GD546X).

   o The support for the 754x series of laptop controllers has been improved.

   o The 24bpp mode on the CL-GD5430/40 has been fixed.









Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



   o Support for the CL-GD5480 has been added.

3.24  SiS driver (SVGA server)

   o Significant updates have been made to the SiS driver (see README.SiS for
     further details).

   o Acceleration support is included, making use of XAA.

   o Linear addressing is supported.

   o Support has been added for 15/16/24bpp.

   o Support has been added for programmable clocks.

   o HW cursor support is included.

3.25  Chips and Technologies driver (SVGA server)

   o Support has been included for the 65525, 65535, 64200 and 64300

   o Problems relating to blank screen at start-up and text mode restoration
     with the 65550 and 65554 should now be fixed

   o Acceleration support for all chips has improved due to the new XAA archi-
     tecture.

   o Many additional minor fixes and documentation updates (see README.chips
     for further details).

3.26  S3 ViRGE driver (SVGA server)

   o Completely new driver for the ViRGE family. The driver works with linear
     addressing and PCI chipsets.

   o Acceleration support uses the XAA architecture.

   o The driver supports 8/15/16/24/32 bpp on all cards.

   o Acceleration includes bitblits, filled rectangles, color expansion and
     pattern fills (8/15/16/24 bpp). Acceleration at 32 bpp is limited to bit-
     blits and filled rectangles.

   o Includes HW cursor support.

   o See README.S3V for further details.

3.27  WD90C24 driver (SVGA server)

   o DPMS support is included (only for "off" mode so far).

3.28  Compaq AVGA driver (SVGA server)










Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



   o The Compaq AVGA driver has been resurrected.  The bugs causing it to not
     work in some previous releases have been fixed.

3.29  Hercules mono driver

   o The problems with the Hercules mono driver in previous releases has now
     been fixed, and the driver is included in this release.

3.30  Client/Library changes

   o The libraries have been updated to R6.3.  The shared lib version numbers
     for libXext and libICE have been bumped to 6.3.  The others remain the
     same.

   o An Xlib problem with non-latin-1 encodings that shows up when using XKB is
     fixed.

   o Some Xlib security vulnerabilities have been fixed.

   o Xterm's emulation of DECUDK (DEC user-defined keys) now (correctly) inter-
     prets shifted keys only.

   o VT52 emulation has been added to xterm.

   o Xterm's VT100 emulation generates correct codes for PF1-PF4, as well as
     the keypad "+" and ",".  These codes differ from the VT220 emulation.

   o Some xterm bugs have been fixed, including coloured background exposure
     while selection is active, and missing state changes in the VT100 emula-
     tion.

   o Xterm's memory requirements for colour have been reduced.	The colour
     resource file is merged with the regular resource file to reduce installa-
     tion problems.

   o Emulation of VT220 soft-reset, and non-DEC REP (repeat) control sequence
     has been added to xterm.

   o Xterm now recognizes control sequences for 16 colors (from aixterm).

   o xset includes support for the DPMS extension.

   o xset's "r rate" flag was broken on some OSs, and is now fixed.

   o Gzipped fonts are now supported.


4.  Installing the XFree86 3.3 Release

The XFree86 3.3 binaries are distributed as a full release, not as an upgrade.

What follows is a list of the XFree86 3.3 components.  There may be some varia-
tions in this for some OSs.

The following are required for all installations:


	  preinst.sh	  Pre-installation script
	  postinst.sh	  Post-installation script
	  X33bin.tgz	  Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
	  X33doc.tgz	  Documentation
	  X33fnts.tgz	  75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
	  X33lib.tgz	  Data files required at run-time
	  X33man.tgz	  Manual pages
	  X33set.tgz	  XF86Setup utility
	  X33VG16.tgz	  16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)


The following is required for new installations, and optional for existing
installations:


	  X33cfg.tgz	  sample config files for xinit, xdm


NOTE: Be very careful about installing X33cfg.tgz over an existing installation
if you have customised your xinit and/or xdm config files.  Installing








Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



X33cfg.tgz will overwrite any existing files.  If you do have customised files,
there is no need to install X33cfg.tgz.

NOTE: The bitmap fonts distributed with this release are compressed using gzip
rather than compress.  This means that you will probably want to remove the old
versions (after backing them up).  The Xservers and font server in previous
releases cannot read gzipped fonts, so keep a copy of the old fonts if you wish
to run older servers.

The following X servers are for PC/AT based hardware (i.e., typical Intel ix86
based PCs).  Choose at least one which matches your hardware, as well as the
VGA16 server.  The VGA16 server is required by the new configuration utility
(XF86Setup).

	  X33lk98.tgz	 X server LinkKit for PC98 servers


If you already have a version of XFree86 installed, MAKE A BACKUP OF /usr/X11R6
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.  The standard installation procedure will overwrite
your existing version of XFree86.

If you are installing from scratch, create a directory called /usr/X11R6, then
extract the required .tgz files.  If you don't have enough space in /usr for
this, create a directory elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it.  E.g., if
you create a directory in /home:

	  mkdir /home/X11R6
	  ln -s /home/X11R6 /usr

The next step is to run the pre-installation script.  This script makes some
preliminary checks of your system.  For some OSs, it may tell you to install
new versions of some system components before proceeding with the installation.
This script may also remove some outdated files and symbolic links from a pre-
vious installation that could cause problems.

Copy the preinst.sh script to /var/tmp, then go to /usr/X11R6 and run it:








Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 3.3



	  cd /usr/X11R6
	  sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh

The .tgz files are gzipped tar files.  To extract them, go to /usr/X11R6, and
run the following as root for each file you need:

	  gzip -d < X33file.tgz | tar vxf -


On some OSs, you might get some "Broken Pipe" messages.  Providing there are no
other messages associated with this, they can be safely ignored.  Note: You
should not be running X while doing this installation.	Doing so may cause the
installation to fail, or cause your X session to crash.

If you are using NetBSD or FreeBSD, a more reliable (and highly recommended)
way of doing this is to extract the .tgz files with:

	     gzip -d < X33file.tgz | tar -v -x --unlink -f -

If you have GNU cpio (as Linux does) or SVR4 cpio, a more reliable (and highly
recommended) way of doing this is to extract the .tgz files with:

	  gzip -d < X33file.tgz | cpio -i -v -d -u -H ustar

Once the required .tgz files have been extracted, copy the postinst.sh script
to /var/tmp, then go to /usr/X11R6 and run it:

	  cd /usr/X11R6
	  sh /var/tmp/postinst.sh

For OSs which use ldconfig (like Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD), you
should either run ldconfig or reboot to complete the installation.  Some Linux
releases don't run ldconfig automatically at reboot, so you may need to run it
manually.  If you are using FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD, and your version of
ldconfig supports the -m option, you can run:

	  ldconfig -m /usr/X11R6/lib


Otherwise for these OSs, check /etc/rc to see how ldconfig gets run at boot
time.
