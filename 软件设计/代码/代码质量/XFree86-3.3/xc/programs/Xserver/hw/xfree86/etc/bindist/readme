A quick example of building a binary dist.

Use the host.def file as a basis for doing the build.

Run 'make World' from the 'xc' directory.

Install first to the standard location with:

  make install

Then build the contrib dist --  from the 'contrib' directory run:

  xmkmf -a
  make
  
As root, install to a new, empty directory:

  cd xc
  make DESTDIR=/home/3.3 install
  make DESTDIR=/home/3.3 install.man
  make DESTDIR=/home/3.3 install.linkkit
  cd ../contrib
  make DESTDIR=/home/3.3 install
  make DESTDIR=/home/3.3 install.man

Copy the bindist/OS/* files to a directory (say, /home/3.3-dist), then
run the build-bindist script to create the binary distribution:

  build-bindist X33 /home/3.3 /home/3.3-dist

The binary dist gets created in /home/3.3-dist/bindist/
