<sect>XFree driver for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 v1.0
<p>
This is the first release of a driver for the above chips. This driver 
has very basic functionality, and does not use the accelerated features of 
the chip. 

<sect1>Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>THE DRIVER DOES NOT SUPPORT THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP FEATURES OF XFREE86 
	This is because the NV1 does not have the necessary hardware to
	support this
	feature. If you want to change resolutions, you will have
	to modify your config file. Comment out all but the mode you wish
	to use.
  <item>The generic VGA16 server will not work with the NV1.  For this reason
	<tt>XF86Setup</tt> cannot be used to configure the server.  Use
	<tt>xf86config</tt> instead.  Select `Diamond Edge 3D' as your board,
	and select only <bf>ONE</bf> mode for each of 8bpp and 16bpp.  Do
	not select a virtual desktop.  Also, make sure you don't select
	a RAMDAC or clock chip.
  <item>The NV1 only supports a 555 RGB Weight in 16 bpp, the hardware does
	not do 565. You must put a Weight 555 in the Display section.
  <item>24/32 bpp mode is not yet supported.
</itemize>

<sect1>Known Bugs
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Corruption of a single pixel in 8bpp mode when switching VCs
  <item>The driver should force Weight 555 in 16 bpp mode
</itemize>
