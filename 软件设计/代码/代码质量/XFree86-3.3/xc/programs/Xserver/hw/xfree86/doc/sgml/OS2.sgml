<sect>Introductory Note about the release 3.3
<p>
Before looking into this file, please check for any LATEST.OS2 files
that may come with the binary distribution. Please also check out the
following XFree86/OS2 WWW pages:
<itemize>
<item><htmlurl name="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html" url="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html"> 
<item><htmlurl name="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86bugs.html" url="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86bugs.html"> 
<item><htmlurl name="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/x11os2faq.html" url="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/x11os2faq.html"> 
</itemize>
before you claim to have found any problems.

This version of the code is called XFree86/OS2 3.3. This is a full, unrestricted
version which does not expire, and for which the complete source code is
available. In contrast to beta versions, we consider this code as sufficiently
stable for use by an end user. Since there have been numerous bugfixes, we
recommend this version, even if you had XFree86/OS2 3.2 before and it worked
satisfyingly with your hardware.

Previous versions have been tested in a large number of configurations
and have been found to be working, with some bugs left, rather flawlessly.

This release is almost complete (with a few exceptions) regarding
the X11R6.3 ``core'' distribution. A subset of the ``contrib'' distribution
is available from the ported software page 
<htmlurl name="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86ported.html" url="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86ported.html"> 

In the past beta testing, it has been found that the software itself is
rather stable and does not damage hardware - provided the user does not
try to push the builtin limits and change certain configuration parameters
which could operate the video hardware out of specs.

However,
<itemize>
<item>even with a code we consider stable there is no explicit or implicit 
       warranty that certain code works correctly or works at all
<item>although no damage reports are known, it does not mean that it is
       impossible to damage hardware with this code; some deeply hidden
       bugs may still be present in the software.
</itemize>

It is recommended that you backup essential data of your system before
installing this software, but this should be your general precautions 
before ANY installation. No reports exist that a crashing X server itself
actively destroys or modifies data, but it is possible in rare cases
that the system is left in an unusable state (video display mode garbled
or system unresponsive, not reacting to mouse or keyboard actions).
If you then hard reset or switch off the system, file caches of the operating
system might not be written correctly back to disk, thus causing data loss.

<sect>What and Where is XFree86?

<p>
XFree86 is a port of X11R6 that supports several versions of
Intel-based Unix.  It is derived from X386 1.2, which was the X server
distributed with X11R5.  This release consists of many new features
and performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.  The release
is available as source patches against the X Consortium X11R6 code, as
well as binary distributions for many architectures.
<p>XFree86/OS2 is the name of the implementation of XFree86
on OS/2 based systems.

See the <htmlurl url="COPYRIGHT.html" name="Copyright Notice">.

sources or binaries.
<p>

Other versions:

XFree86/OS2 will run on all dialects of Warp 3, including Warp "red spine box",
Warp "blue spine box", Warp Connect, Warp Server, and Warp 4.

For Warp 3 installing fixpack level 17 is strongly recommended, newer 
fixpacks like 22 also work. There have been a few reports that the
installation of FP26 causes XFree86 no longer to work, but I am not sure
about a real reason.

Warp 4 may be used with or without the recent public fixpack FP1.

Please check in all cases a LATEST.OS2 file.

OS/2 2.11 is not supported any longer with this release, due to lack
of a working test environment. Consequently, OS/2 SMP is not supported either,
because this is currently based on OS/2 2.11. Warp Server SMP is supported, 
but SMP does not give significant advantage, other than the general speedup
because of multiple processors working.
OS/2 versions 1.X are definitely not supported and will never be.

It is possible to build XFree86/OS2 from the sources.  Read about this
in the document OS2.NOTES.

<sect>Bug Reports for This Document

Send email to <em/Holger.Veit@gmd.de/ (Holger Veit) or
<em/XFree86@XFree86.org/ if you have comments or suggestions about
this file and we'll revise it.

<sect>Hardware and Software Requirements

<p>
<sect1>Supported, Required, and Recommended Hardware

<p>
<itemize>
<item>At least a 486DX33 with 16MB RAM is required. A Pentium or Pentium Pro
       and more main memory is recommended. A 386 or a system with 8MB or less
       memory is an insufficient configuration.
<item>There are no specific requirements concerning network cards, disk types,
       or CD ROM equipment; of course the more powerful, the better.
<item>Depending on the packages installed, a disk space of 20-55MB on a
       HPFS formatted partition (or a NFS partition natively allowing long 
       filenames) is required. XFree86/OS2 will not run on FAT partitions.
<item>You need a video card that is supported by XFree86. Refer to the general
       README document for a list of supported cards. Note that the sets
       of video cards supported by XFree86 on one hand and OS/2 on the other 
       hand overlap, but do not match exactly, i.e. the fact that your card
       is supported by OS/2 does not mean it works with XFree86 as well, and
       vice versa. XFree86 does not use the video services of the OS/2
       operating system.
</itemize>

<sect1>Required Software

<p>
<itemize>
<item>Any version of Warp 3 with at least fixpack 17, or Warp 4 is required
<item>XFree86/OS2-3.3 may use a local named-pipe connection or a TCP/IP 
       based network connection.
       <enum>
       <item>Warp comes with the Internet Access Kit (IAK), which is
              sufficient. Warp Connect and Warp Server come with a full
              version of TCP/IP (3.0). Use of this software is preferred over
              IAK then.
       <item>Warp 4 comes with TCP/IP 4.0 which should also work.
       <item>The old IBM TCP/IP 2.0, that comes with the IBM PMX product
              may be used with Warp as well, although it is no longer supported
	      by IBM. Please ensure that you have the latest CSDs installed.
       </enum>
       Other versions of TCP/IP, such as FTP's, DEC's, or Hummingbird's 
       TCP/IP versions, as well as IBM TCP/IP 1.X are not supported. Nor does
       any networking support from DOS (packet drivers, winsock), Netware,
       or NetBIOS work, and I won't to provide support for that in the future.
<item>If you want to write or port applications for XFree86, you are
       encouraged to do so. You will need a complete installation of
       EMX/gcc 0.9C or later for doing so. Neither the second (obsolete)
       implementation of gcc, nor any commercial package, including
       Cset/2, VAC++, Borland C++/OS2, Watcom C++, Metaware C, and others,
       is suitable for porting, because various parts of the X DLLs rely
       on certain features only present with EMX.
</itemize>

<sect>Installing the System

<p>
The binary distribution is composed of a number of zip archives
which are the executables, servers, fonts, libraries, include files,
man pages, and config files.  The full distribution requires about 
40-55MB of disk space.  

All archives of this alpha version are packed with the <tt/info-zip/ utility, 
which is available under the name <tt/UNZ512X2.EXE/ from many OS/2 archives.
Please obtain a native OS/2 version of this unpacker. DOS <tt/PKUNZIP/ does
not work, because it cannot unpack long file names and extended attributes.

At this moment, the distribution covers only the ``core'' distribution
which somewhat reduces the usability. Refer to WWW sites and archives listed 
in the XFree86/OS2 FAQ and elsewhere to obtain pre-built X clients which
were ported to XFree86.

    The contents of the packages are:

<descrip>
<tag/REQUIRED:/
    <descrip>
    <tag/X33base/	A special device driver and the SuperProbe program
    <tag/X33doc/	READMEs and XFree86 specific man pages.
    <tag/X33bin/	all of the executable X client applications and shared libs
    <tag/X33fnts/	the misc and 75dpi fonts
    <tag/emxrt/         Runtime libraries of EMX
    </descrip>

    Choose at least one of the following to match your hardware:

    <descrip>
    <tag/X338514/	the X server for IBM 8514/A and compatible boards
    <tag/X33AGX/	the X server for AGX boards
    <tag/XA32AI128/	the X server for &num;9 Imagination 128 boards
    <tag/X33Ma32/	the X server for ATI Mach32 graphics boards
    <tag/X33Ma64/	the X server for ATI Mach64 graphics boards
    <tag/X33Ma8/	the X server for ATI Mach8 graphics boards
    <tag/X33Mono/	the Monochrome X Server
    <tag/X33P9K/	the X server for P9000 based boards
    <tag/X33S3/ 	the X server for S3 based boards (excluding S3 ViRGE)
    <tag/X33S3V/ 	the X server for S3 ViRGE based boards
    <tag/X33SVGA/	the 8-bit pseudo-color X server for Super VGA cards
    <tag/X33VG16/	the 4-bit pseudo-color X server for VGA &amp; SVGA cards.
    <tag/X33W32/	the X server for et4000w32 based boards
    </descrip>

<tag/OPTIONAL:/

    <descrip>
    <tag/X33man/ 	pre-formatted man pages for the X11 interface and clients
    <tag/X33f100/	100dpi fonts
    <tag/X33fscl/	Speedo and Type1 fonts
    <tag/X33fnon/ 	Japanese, Chinese and other fonts
    <tag/X33fcyr/	Cyrillic fonts
    <tag/X33fsrv/	the font server with man pages.
    <tag/X33prog/	the X11 header files and programmer's utilities
			for compiling other X applications
    <tag/X33pex/	PEX fonts and libraries required for PEX applications
    </descrip>
</descrip>

In order to save space on your disk and reduce net bandwidth, choose the
software to obtain carefully. Each X server is an archive of about 1.2MB
and occupies 3.0MB on the disk. You won't normally need more than the
single Xserver tailored to your video card.

If it is your first time install, get the <tt/X33base/ archive before any
of the other packages. This package contains a driver and a test program,
which analyzes your video hardware. If this program fails or reports an
incompatible hardware, it makes no sense to obtain the other packages in
the hope that they would magically work.

<sect>Troubleshooting

<p>
Surprised to see this section directly in the beginning? We have put it here
because chances are best here not to overlook it. This does not mean that
you will necessarily encounter trouble when installing XFree86, but be warned:
the following sections are <bf/IMPORTANT/ and neglecting one or more things
out of impatience or sloppiness will leave you with a non-working X11
system and us with unnecessary problems.

Still, due to the incredibly large number of hardware configurations, there 
may be some special situations and configurations where the below description
is not successful. If this happens, read - I repeat <bf/READ/ - the list
of ``frequently asked questions'' (FAQ) which has meanwhile evolved to
a troubleshooting guide. The latest version is always at
<htmlurl name="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/x11os2faq.html" url="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/x11os2faq.html"> .

Maybe - but we found you must be very creative - you find a bug. Consult the
page <htmlurl name="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86bugs.html" url="http://set.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86bugs.html"> 
whether it is already known. If not, you have a case and should report it
to XFree86 (<em/xfree86@xfree86.org/). Please refer to the FAQ about the
information to be provided for a complete problem report.

The recommended newsgroup for setup questions is <em/comp.os.os2.setup.misc/.
I read this group, so it won't speed up the process or enforce anything if
you post to other groups, or forward the report to my mail address as well
or to xfree86@xfree86.org.

So, not to discourage you completely, the setup section begins:


<sect>Checking Compatibility of Video Hardware

<p>
In the following, we assume that you want to install XFree86/OS2 on a disk
drive with the letter Y: (which you probably don't have). Change the letter
in all commands accordingly.

<enum>
<item>Obtain the package <tt/X33base/ and install it from the root directory
       of the Y: drive, by entering the following commands:
<tscreen><verb>
[C:\] Y:
[Y:\] cd \
[Y:\] unzip \path_of_package\X33base.zip
</verb></tscreen>

<item>Edit your CONFIG.SYS file to contain the following line somewhere:
<tscreen><verb>
DEVICE=Y:\XFree86\lib\xf86sup.sys
</verb></tscreen>
       Of course replace ``Y:'' with the correct drive letter.

<item>At this point, you may consider to add the variables required for
       XFree86/OS2 as well, which will save you from one additional reboot.
       Refer to section <ref id="envvar" name="Adding Variables to CONFIG.SYS">
       below.

<item>After adding the device driver entry to the CONFIG.SYS file, you must
       reboot to install the driver. XFree86/OS2 will not work without this
       driver.

<item>Start a full screen OS/2 CMD session and enter the following
       command:
<tscreen><verb>
[C:\] Y:\XFree86\bin\SuperProbe
</verb></tscreen>

<item>This command will (normally) report important information about your
       video configuration, i.e. the type of chipset, the available video
       memory and the RAMDAC circuit available. Please write this down or
       redirect the output of ``SuperProbe'' into a file by entering:
<tscreen><verb>
[C:\] Y:\XFree86\bin\SuperProbe >filename
</verb></tscreen>

<item>SuperProbe can identify many more video cards than are supported by
       XFree86. In some cases, SuperProbe unfortunately detects a wrong
       card, often it claims to have seen a MCGA card which is some sort of
       a fallback. Generally, if it is approximately right, there are only
       few reasons for doubts; if it is totally off (e.g. saying it has
       seen a ET4000, and you have a Cirrus card), you should report a
       mis-detection as a bug to the given address. In all cases, please
       take the few minutes and check the accompanying README.* files to
       check for special precautions, options, or features of the card.

<item>If the README files tell you that your hardware is supported, please
       obtain the rest of the software.

</enum>

<sect>Installing the packages

<p>
XFree86/OS2 assumes a directory hierarchy starting from <tt>drive:&bsol;XFree86</tt>.
This can be changed, but is strictly discouraged.

<enum>
<item>Choose a HPFS partition with sufficient free space.
<item>For each package to install, go to the root directory of this
       drive, and type:
<tscreen><verb>
drive:> cd \
drive:> unzip \path_of_packages\X33xxxx.zip
</verb></tscreen>
<item>You might encounter that some packages report duplicate files, e.g.
the X server packages install corresponding README files, which are also
in the X33doc package. This is okay, the files are the same. Let unzip
replace the files.
<item>There is no special sequence of installing packages required.
</enum>

<sect>Adding Variables to CONFIG.SYS <label id="envvar">

<p>
XFree86/OS2 requires a number of settings in the CONFIG.SYS file to work
correctly. Please add the following settings:

<descrip>
<tag/TERM/
	Set the preferred terminal type for the xterm or editor to be used.
	Some programs need this setting. I have my type set to
<tscreen><verb>SET TERM=ansi</verb></tscreen>
	<tt>&bsol;XFree86&bsol;lib&bsol;X11&bsol;etc&bsol;termcap.x11</tt>
	contains a suitable termcap which
	can be used in place of termcap files that come with EMX, EMACS, or
	other ported software.
<tag/TERMCAP/
	This variable must be set to the location where the termcap file
	used for the above <tt/TERM/ variable is searched. My setting, for
	instance, is:
<tscreen><verb>SET TERMCAP=D:/EMX/ETC/TERMCAP.X11</verb></tscreen>
	Note that forward ``/'' is used as a directory separator.
<tag/ETC/
	Set to an ETC directory. Normally, this is already set to the ETC
        directory of the TCP/IP code, such as
<tscreen><verb>SET ETC=C:&bsol;TCPIP&bsol;ETC</verb></tscreen>
<tag/TMP/
	Set to an TMP directory. Normally, this is already set to the TMP
        directory of the TCP/IP code, such as
<tscreen><verb>SET TMP=C:&bsol;TCPIP&bsol;TMP</verb></tscreen>
<tag/HOSTNAME/
	Set to the internet hostname. Normally, this is already set by the
	TCP/IP installation program, such as
<tscreen><verb>SET HOSTNAME=myhost</verb></tscreen>
	With IAK, you would normally run a loopback configuration 
	<ref id="loopback" name="Network configuration"> and would then
	set this to
<tscreen><verb>SET HOSTNAME=localhost</verb></tscreen>
<tag/USER/

<tag/LOGNAME/
	Set both to a username. Currently, they are there just to make some
	programs happy; in the future, this variable might be set by a
	login shell of a multiuser configuration. My variable, for instance,
	is set to
<tscreen><verb>
        SET USER=holger
        SET LOGNAME=holger
</verb></tscreen>
<tag/HOME/
	Set this to an existing directory that is supposed to be a home directory
	of a user. Some utilities place temporary and init files here. This
	is also future investment for a multiuser configuration, but must still
	be there. For instance, this variable might be set to
<tscreen><verb>SET HOME=H:&bsol;user&bsol;holger</verb></tscreen>
<tag/X11ROOT/
	This is one of the most important settings, it determines the root
	of the XFree86 directory tree. Normally, you will set this to the
	drive letter of the partition where the &bsol;XFree86 tree resides,
	such as in
<tscreen><verb>SET X11ROOT=Y:</verb></tscreen>
	You may try to move the tree to another subdirectory, e.g. to
	<tt>K:&bsol;OS2&bsol;X11&bsol;XFree86...</tt> and would then have
	to change this to
<tscreen><verb>SET X11ROOT=K:/OS2/X11</verb></tscreen>,
	but this is discouraged, since some utilities might not accept this.
	Note the forward ``/'' as a directory separator here.
<tag/DISPLAY/
	This variable may be set to the display to be used for displaying
	clients. Normally you will set this variable to the same value as
	the <tt/HOSTNAME/ variable and simply add a <tt/:0.0/ after it, such as
<tscreen><verb>SET DISPLAY=myhost:0.0</verb></tscreen>
	Read the X11 man page on the exact meaning of these postfixes and
	other options.
<tag/XSERVER/
	Set this to the executable name of the X server to be used. This
	must be a complete path. My setting is as follows:
<tscreen><verb>SET XSERVER=D:/XFree86/bin/XF86_Mach64.exe</verb></tscreen>
<tag/PATH/
	Add the binary directory for the X11 utilities to your search PATH.
	This is normally the directory (adjust the letter)
<tscreen><verb>Y:&bsol;XFree86&bsol;bin</verb></tscreen>
	It is possible to move the binaries to another directory in the
	search path; for maintenance reasons and clarity of the structure, this
	is not recommended, though.
<tag/LIBPATH/
	Add the DLL directory for the X11 utilities to the LIBPATH.
	This is normally the directory (adjust the letter)
<tscreen><verb>Y:&bsol;XFree86&bsol;lib</verb></tscreen>
	It is possible to move the DLLs to another directory in the
	library path; for maintenance reasons and clarity of the structure, 
	this is not recommended, though. Note that
	<tt>Y:&bsol;XFree86&bsol;lib</tt>
	has several other subdirectories; these may not be moved elsewhere,
	rather they must stay there, because most utilities form a path to
	these directories by using <tt>%X11ROOT%&bsol;XFree86&bsol;lib</tt>
	as a base.
</descrip>

The recent version of XFree86/OS2 has a REXX script named <tt/checkinstall.cmd/
which you can (and should) use to check whether you have entered most things
correctly. This is not bullet-proof, but prevents the most obvious 
setup problems. Also, the X server itself will do some checking and will
refuse to start if something is wrong.

<sect>Remarks on the Network Configuration

<p>
It is beyond the scope of this document to even give an introduction about
the correct installation of the TCP/IP networking system. You must do this
yourself or seek assistance elsewhere. It is only possible to say here that
a PC working well in a TCP/IP based LAN network will also work with 
XFree86/OS2 (when all other prerequisites are matched as well). 

<label id="loopback">With IAK, there is a special configuration necessary,
unless you want to use XFree86/OS2 only during a hot link to your Internet
provider, the so called ``localhost'' or ``loopback'' configuration. This is
a local network interface which ``loops'' back to the same host. The following
settings are necessary for this:

<enum>
<item>Create a file <tt>&bsol;tcpip&bsol;etc&bsol;hosts</tt> with the
	following content:
<tscreen><verb>127.0.0.1  localhost</verb></tscreen>
<item>Add the following line to your
	<tt>&bsol;tcpip&bsol;bin&bsol;tcpstart.cmd</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up</verb></tscreen>
<item>Uncomment the <tt/inetd/ process in the same file.
<item>Set the HOSTNAME environment variable to <tt/localhost/ as described
       in the last section.
<item>Add the following line to CONFIG.SYS:
<tscreen><verb>SET USE_HOSTS_FIRST=1</verb></tscreen>
<item>After rebooting, verify that the following command works:
<tscreen><verb>[C:&bsol;] ping localhost</verb></tscreen>
</enum>

The <tt/checkinstall.cmd/ script coming with XFree86/OS2 gives some advice
here as well.

If you have problems to get this or other basic networking things running,
seek assistance elsewhere.

<sect>Configuring X for Your Hardware

<p>
After you have added the required settings and setup a working network,
run the <tt/xf86config/ program to create a standard configuration file
in <tt>Y:&bsol;XFree86&bsol;lib&bsol;X11&bsol;XConfig</tt> from a windowed
or full screen OS/2 text session:
<tscreen><verb>[C:&bsol;] xf86config</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/xf86config/ program will ask a number of questions. You will need 
the information obtained from the SuperProbe program here. The program should 
be self explanatory; if you have problems to understand something though, seek
assistance in the newsgroups.

It is possible, but strongly discouraged for the non-expert, to edit the
<tt/XConfig/ file with a text editor. In a few situations, as described in
the FAQ, this might even be mandatory. This file is not a hacker's area,
such as the Win95 registry, but it has in common with it that you can
easily cause damage.

For details about the <tt/XF86Config/ file format, refer to the
<em>XF86Config(4/5)</em> manual page.

If you know the configuration process from Linux or other XFree86 platform, 
you will encounter a few differences:
<itemize>
<item>The configuration file is named <tt/XF86Config/ in Unix environments.
<item>There is no configuration for the mouse type or device. The mouse
       device name is fixed to OSMOUSE, and this cannot be changed.
       If you have a three-button-mouse, install the correct OS/2 driver 
       for it, such as
<tscreen><verb>
DEVICE=D:&bsol;OS2&bsol;BOOT&bsol;PCLOGIC.SYS SERIAL=COM1
DEVICE=D:&bsol;OS2&bsol;BOOT&bsol;MOUSE.SYS TYPE=PCLOGIC$
</verb></tscreen>
       for a MouseSystems compatible mouse, for instance.
<item>The X server does not read the native OS/2 keyboard map,
       so you need a xmodmap file for a non-us keyboard. Fortunately, it
       is the same you use for Linux. Alternatively, for standard keyboards,
       you can also use the XKB extension which is offered during the
       <tt/xf86config/ dialogue, provided your language is available.
<item>There is no support for the Wacom and Elographics input devices yet.
</itemize>

In most cases, an existing <tt/XF86Config/ file for the same XFree86 version
from Linux or another platform may be used without changes. There is one 
prominent exception: some S3 805 based VLB cards put their video memory
in odd locations. The X server can search for this memory by experimentally
mapping and unmapping possible memory regions. In XFree86/OS2, the OS may
run out of memory tiles during this process. If this happens, you must
find out the location of the memory yourself and add it as an option
<tscreen><verb>
	MemBase 0x12345678
</verb></tscreen>
to the XConfig file.

Once you've set up a XF86Config file, you can fine tune the video
modes with the <tt>xvidtune</tt> utility. 

<sect>Running X

<p>
16mb of memory is a recommended minimum for running the network software,
X and the presentation manager in parallel.  The server, window manager and 
an xterm take about 4-6 Mb of memory themselves.  X will start up on a
system with 8MB or less, but the performance will severely suffer from
heavy disk swapping. Your mileage may vary, though, so some people might
consider this still tolerable.

The easiest way for new users to start X windows is to type: 
<tscreen><verb>[C:&bsol;] startx</verb></tscreen>.

To get out of X windows, type: ``<tt/exit/'' in the console xterm.
You can customize your X by creating <tt/.xinitrc/, <tt/.xserverrc/,
and <tt/.twmrc/ files in the directory that the <tt/HOME/ environment 
variable points to. These files are described in the xinit and startx
man pages.

By default, the systemwide <tt/xinitrc/ file (in <tt>Y:/XFree86/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.cmd</tt>)
installs the rather simplistic <tt/twm/ window manager. You can find better
window managers on the ported software page at

<sect>Rebuilding the XFree86 Distribution

<p>
Do you really want to rebuild XFree86/OS2 from source? Read the file
<htmlurl name=OS2.Notes url=OS2Notes.html>
on details to recompile XFree86/OS2 from scratch.

<sect>Building New X Clients

<p>
The easiest way to build a new client (X application) is to use
<tt/xmkmf/ if an <tt/Imakefile/ is included in the sources.  Type
``<tt/xmkmf -a/'' to create the Makefiles, check the configuration if
necessary and type ``<tt/xmake/''. ``<tt/xmake/'' is a wrapper for the
GNU make program which defeats the improper SHELL setting typically found
in a Makefile generated from an Imakefile. Also see the XFree86/OS2 FAQ 
for more hints about porting X clients.
