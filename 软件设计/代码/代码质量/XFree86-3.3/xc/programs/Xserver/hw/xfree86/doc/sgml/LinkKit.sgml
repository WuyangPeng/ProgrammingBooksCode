<sect>Readme for the XFree86 3.3 LinkKit <p>
<enum>
<item>For systems which don't use gcc-2, you may need to install libgcc.a if
   the binary distribution you are using was built with gcc-2.

<item>Make sure that you have the XFree86 3.3 libraries
   installed under <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> if you will be linking Xnest with
   the LinkKit.  The LinkKit is now self-contained for the other servers.

<item>Edit the <tt/xf86site.def/ file to define which servers you want
   to build, and the drivers and extensions you want included.

    <itemize>
    <item>Set <tt>HasGcc</tt> and <tt>HasGcc2</tt> to match the compiler
      you are using if the defaults aren't correct.
    <item>If the LinkKit was built with gcc-2.x and you are using some other
      compiler, you must install libgcc.a and set <tt>NeedLibGcc</tt> to
      <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the 256 colour server:
	set <tt>XF86SVGAServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the 16 colour server:
	set <tt>XF86VGA16Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the monochrome server:
	set <tt>XF86MonoServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the S3 server:
	set <tt>XF86S3Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the Mach8 server:
	set <tt>XF86Mach8Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the Mach32 server:
	set <tt>XF86Mach32Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the Mach64 server:
	set <tt>XF86Mach64Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the P9000 server:
	set <tt>XF86P9000Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the AGX server:
	set <tt>XF86AGXServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the ET4000/W32 server:
	set <tt>XF86W32Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the IBM 8514/A server:
	set <tt>XF86I8514Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the I128 server:
	set <tt>XF86I128Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the TGA server:
	set <tt>XF86TGAServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the GA-98NB/WAP server:
	set <tt>XF98GANBServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the NEC480 server:
	set <tt>XF98NEC480Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the NEC-CIRRUS/EPSON NKV/NKV2 server:
	set <tt>XF98NKVNECServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the WAB-S server:
	set <tt>XF98WABSServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the WAB-EP server:
	set <tt>XF98WABEPServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the WSN-A2F server:
	set <tt>XF98WSNAServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the Trident Cyber9320/9680 server:
	set <tt>XF98TGUIServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the EGC server:
	set <tt>XF98EGCServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the NEC S3 server:
	set <tt>XF98NECS3Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the S3 PW/PCSKB server:
	set <tt>XF98PWSKBServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the S3 PW/LB server:
	set <tt>XF98PWLBServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To build the S3 GA-968 server:
	set <tt>XF98GA968Server</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.

    <item>To build the Xnest server:
	set <tt>XnestServer</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.

    <item>If you are building more than one Xserver, uncomment the
        <tt>ServerToInstall</tt> line and set it to the name of the
        Xserver you want to be the default server (i.e., the one that
        the ``X'' sym-link points to).

    <item>Set <tt>XF86SvgaDrivers</tt> to the list of drivers you want to
	include in the SVGA server.
    <item>Set <tt>XF86Vga16Drivers</tt> to the list of drivers you want to
	include in the 16 colour server.
    <item>Set <tt>XF86Vga2Drivers</tt> to the list of drivers you want to
	include in the monochrome vga server.
    <item>Set<tt> XF86MonoDrivers</tt> to the list of non-vga mono drivers
	you want to include in the mono or VGA16 servers (when building
	dual-headed servers).
    <item>Note: the ordering of drivers determines the order in which the
        probing is done.  The `<tt>generic</tt>' driver should be the last one
        included in the Mono and VGA16 and SVGA servers because its probe
        always succeeds.
    <item>To use dynamically loadable modules(e.g. PEX, XIE):
	set <tt>ExtensionsDynamicModules</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To include the PEX extension:
	set <tt>BuildPexExt</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To include the X Image Extension:
	set <tt>BuildXIE</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To include the GLX Extension:
	set <tt>BuildGlxExt</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>.
    <item>To exclude the Double Buffer Extension:
	set <tt>BuildDBE</tt> to <tt>NO</tt>.
    <item>To exclude the Record Extension:
	set <tt>BuildRECORD</tt> to <tt>NO</tt>.
    <item>To exclude the Screen Saver extension:
	set <tt>BuildScreenSaverExt</tt> to <tt>NO</tt>.
    <item>Although it is possible to disable other extensions through this
	mechanism, doing so is not recommended because savings in server size
	are not appreciable, or the resulting server might even be crippled in
	some way.

    </itemize>

<item>If you are including a driver that it not part of the standard
   distribution, make a directory in <tt>drivers/vga256</tt>
   (<tt>drivers/vga2</tt> if it is for the VGA2 part of the Mono server,
    <tt>drivers/vga16</tt> if it is for the 16
   colour server, or <tt>drivers/mono</tt> non-VGA part of the Mono and VGA16
   servers) and copy either the source or .o file and a suitable Imakefile
   into that directory.  The name of the directory should be the same as the
   name of the driver (refer to the documentation in the <tt>VGADriverDoc</tt>
   directory for more details).

<item>To build the Makefile, run
<verb>
  ./mkmf
</verb>
<item>Run `<tt>make</tt>' to link the server(s) as configured.

<item>Run `<tt>make install</tt>' to install the new server(s).

<item>Run `<tt>make clean</tt>' to remove the files that were created by this
   procedure.

<item>If you edit the <tt/xf86site.def/ file and change the selection
   of servers
   being built or the drivers included in them, repeat the above procedure.
   If changing the selection of Xserver extensions being included it is
   sufficient to run `<tt>make Makefile</tt>' instead of `<tt>./mkmf</tt>'.

<item>It is possible to see which drivers are included in the Xserver by
   running it with the `<tt>-showconfig</tt>' flag.  To check which extensions
   are included, start the Xserver and run `<tt>xdpyinfo</tt>'.
