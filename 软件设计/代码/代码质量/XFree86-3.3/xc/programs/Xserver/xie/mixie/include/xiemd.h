** Bit operations:
**
**		DATATYPE DEPENDENT:
**  LogInt -	Should be chosen as the largest efficient unsigned type which
**		supports C based logical operations, as well as loads and
**		stores.  This will usually be 32 bit unsigned long, but 
**		might conceivably be an 64 bit type on some newer machines.
**		If you change this, update LOGSHIFT.
**  LOGSHIFT -	Log2 of LOGSIZE
**  LOGSIZE -	Size of LogInt in bits.  You should make sure your compiler
**		knows that this is really 32 and not (4<<3).
**  LOGMASK -	Make sure your compiler thinks this is 31 and not ((4<<3)-1)
**
**		ENDIAN DEPENDENT:
**  LOGLEFT -	LeftMost bit (from screen perspective) in a LogInt.
**  LOGRIGHT -	In place shift of a LogInt right 1 bit (in screen perspective)>
**
**  LOGINDX,LOGBIT - Used by LOG_xxxbit macros for individual access to bits.
**  LOG_tstbit - test if a bit from memory is set.
**  LOG_chgbit - test if a bit in memory differs from a constant.
**  LOG_setbit,LOG_clrbit,LOG_xorbit  - set, clr, or xor a bit in memory.
**  
**  Some pieces of bit related code have been written to use word loops
**  using LogInt Bits at a time.  Some algorithms use LOG_xxxbit macros
**  to access individual bits.

** can consistently use floats instead of doubles on machines which 
** can do floats quicker than doubles:

**	typedef float BlendFloat;	(see mpblend.c)
**	typedef float ConstrainFloat;	(see mpcnst.c)
**	typedef float DitherFloat;	(see mpdither.c)
**	typedef float ConvolveFloat;	(see element.h)
**	typedef float PasteUpFloat;	(see element.h)
**
** Some functions are not yet written to this standard.  For instance
** geometry is susceptible to roundoff errors keeping track of scanline
** threshold data maps.

** USE_FLOATS is used in mpcnst.c to enable the originaly easy to
** program floating point ClipScale routines.  The current integer
** based routine no longer does a divide and is hence probably faster

** integer versus floating algorithms in the future.  We would perhaps
** like to select between them here.
