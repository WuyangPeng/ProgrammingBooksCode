			PEX-SI User Guide

This document will help you get started with the PEX-SI.  It includes
an overview of the menu hierarchy and a description of each of the 
documents delivered with PEX-SI.  It also provides instruction on using
the various PEX-SI programs and clients.

This directory contains the PostScript files you need to print the User Guide.  

	cover.ps -- The cover sheet
	contents.ps -- The table of contents
	tables.ps -- The list of tables
	figures.ps -- The list of figures
	doc.ps -- The chapter and appendix body pages.
	index.ps -- The index

On most systems you can use lpr to print the files.  You should print in the 
order listed above so you do not have to collate.  The document is designed 
to be double sided, and each part of the document (i.e. table of contents, 
tables and figures listings, chapters and index) begins on an odd page number.  
You may have to supply some blank pages before copying.

This directory also contains the document troff source files. The document 
consists of 5 files:

	cover.ug -- The cover sheet
	user_guide -- All of the User Guide chapters
	server_app.ug -- The server functional description
	archive_app.ug -- The archive file information

In addition, this directory contains this README and a Makefile.  The targets
included in the Makefile are:

	all --	Troffs all document files into dit (device independent troff) files.
		It also creates an index, table of contents, and table and figure 
		listings.  The resultant files are cover.dit, contents.dit 
		(table of contents), tables.dit, figures.dit, doc.dit (all chapters), 
		and index.dit. 

		Note: You will have to provide your own mechanism for converting
		the files to PostScript files if you are going to use the Makefile. 

	clean -- If you modify the text in anyway and want to `re-make' the
		document, you should first do a ``make clean'' before doing a 
		``make all''.  This target will remove all dit files, the 
		slush.file and the outline file created in the previous make.
