.Dt POFFD 8
.Sh NAME
.Nm poffd
.Nd "X68k shutdown deamon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm poffd
.Op Ar shutdown-program
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Poffd
looks at the power switch of x68k.
When the switch is turned off,
.Nm poffd
executes
.Ar shutdown-program
.Po
using
.Pa /bin/sh -c
.Pc .

If the system is started by x68k's RTC timer,
.Ar shutdown-program
is executed when the system's shut down time (predefined using
other utility, SX-Window Control Pannel and
.Xr rtcalarm 8
for example) arrives.

The argument
.Ar shutdown-program
may contain the character `%'. It is substituted with a number
which indicates the way how the system was started:
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
0: Front power switch
.It
1: External (I/O slot) power signal
.It
2: RTC alarm
.El
This is useful when choosing the shutdown message.

If the argument
.Ar shutdown-program
is omitted, `/sbin/shutdown -r +1' is executed instead.
