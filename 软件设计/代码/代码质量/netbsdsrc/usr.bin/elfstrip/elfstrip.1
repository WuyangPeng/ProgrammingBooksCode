.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm elfstrip
.Nd remove unnecessary information from ELF executable files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
deletes the relocation information and symbol table used by
assemblers, loaders and debuggers.
This significantly
decreases the size of the installed binaries and saves disk space.
.Pp
.Nm
is more aggressive about stripping unecessary information
than the GNU equivalent.  The
GNU binutils
.Xr size 1
utility uses the "unecessary" information and  may not be able to
find the size of executable segments of stripped files.
The strippped files are still correctly executed.
.Pp
.Nm
exits 0 on success and 1 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
