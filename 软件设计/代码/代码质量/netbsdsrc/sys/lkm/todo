Always a lot to do.  :)

o  Learn how loadable devices can configure themselves, like the interrupt,
   dma, probing, attaching, etc.  Then start adding some of those to the
   lkm tree.

o  Figgure out if binary emulation (freebsd, linux, ultrix, etc) can be
   made loadable or not.  [They can be.  I have some kernel mods which
   will make freebsd and linux loadable at least]

o  decide if lfs is useful in any way as is, or if it should install
   syscalls as well.  Of course, it's broken in other ways, but...
   [it will have to install syscalls]

o  decide if it is even useful to make ffs into a loadable module.
   [for diskless boots, sure, why not]

o  what about nfs?  Server and client should both be loadable I suppose.
   [good luck...]
