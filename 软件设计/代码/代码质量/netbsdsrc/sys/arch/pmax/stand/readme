This directory does  not build anything for the NetBSD/pmax 1.3 release.

The NetBSD/pmax bootblocks shipped in 1.3 support reading symbols from
a.out kernels and providing them to DDB. These new bootblocks are
built from source that was not integrated into the NetBSD tree in time
for the release.  (they require changes to the libsa code, and the
pmax stand/ tree should be reorganized, e.g., as the i386 tree has
been.)

A tar file containing the bootblock source tree is available on
ftp.netbsd.org:~ftp/pub/NetBSD/arch/pmax/bootblock-1.3.tar.gz.  The
bootblock source will also be folded into NetBSD-current shortly after
the release.

The `dec_label' program in this directory is also deprecated.  The new
bootblocks are so big that they overlay the space used by Ultrix
labels.  Trying to write an Ultrix-compatible label may clobber hte
bootblock.  therefore have not built dec_label for this release.
