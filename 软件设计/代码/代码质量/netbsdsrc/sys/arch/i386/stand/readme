$NetBSD: README,v 1.1.1.1 1997/03/14 02:40:29 perry Exp $

[This is Matthias Drochner's original README, very lightly edited.]

libsa-based bootcode for i386
should work with -current libsa (I used 97/02/06.)

contents:
./libsa: additions to sys/lib/libsa, not i386 specific
./lib: i386 specific parts
./lib/netif: driver for ethernet adapters
./biosboot: boot sector for hd / fd
./installboot: program to install boot sector
./dosboot: DOS program to boot from DOS or UFS drives
./netboot: ROM image for diskless boot
./genprom: program to create ROM image

to build:
make, hopefully
perhaps adjust "S" to location of kernel sources

notes:
-to install bootsect:
  mount /dev/XdNa /somewhere
  installboot biosboot.sym /dev/rXdNa
-netboot ethernet cards:
  select with USE_NETIF
  for wd80x3, BASEREG and BASEMEM must be set properly
  for pcnet_isapnp, ISAPNPID must be set properly
-text+data+bss+stack <= 64k, heap can be above

Please report all errors!
