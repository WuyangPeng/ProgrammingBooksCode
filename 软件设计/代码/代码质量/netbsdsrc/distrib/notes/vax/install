Installing NetBSD/vax may be a little bit complex, but it shouldn't be too
hard if you have this document available.

Device conventions.
NetBSD standalone system addresses devices like
'devicename(adapter, controller, unit, partition)'
Known devicenames are:
        mt  -  MSCP tape. (TK50, TU81, ...)
        ts  -  TSV05/TS11 tape.
        ra  -  RA??/RD?? disks/floppies.
        hp  -  RP??/RM?? disks.
        rd  -  RD?? disks on MicroVAX 2000.
        sd  -  SCSI disks.
        st  -  SCSI tapes.
        le  -  LANCE ethernet controller.

You can omit parameters; ra(0,0) refers to disk 0 partition a
on default controller. On tapes partition refers to file #
on the tape.

Example: DUB1 (DEC syntax) swap partition will be referred as
        ra(1,0,1), DRA2 root partition is hp(2,0).


The installation principle is to label the root disk, copy a miniroot
filesystem onto the swap partition, boot up from that miniroot filesystem,
then create root and the other wanted partitions and put system to it.
You will have to deal with 2 different "units", one is just a boot
filesystem containing 3 files: boot, copy and edlabel, the other is an
image of a miniroot filesystem and can be split into several pieces
depending of what you are going to install from.


Installation from tape: (MicroVAX II/III)
Take your newly created boot tape and just boot from it:

        >>> B/3 MUA0

This means that you will bring upp boot to aks for boot file from TK50.
(MUA0 is DEC naming). It will come up something like

          2..1..0..


        howto 0x3, bdev 0x12, booting...done. (31248+22252)

	>> NetBSD/vax boot [970610 23:44] <<
        : 


At the prompt you type edlabel to label the disk, see below about
how to use edlabel.
When labeling is finished, halt the computer, bring up the boot program
again and this time load copy, see below about how to use copy.
Remember that you must copy from the second file (1) on the tape.

Now go to step 3.


Installation from RX33/RX50. (MicroVAX II/III)
The difference between RX33 and RX50 is its size. RX50 is 400k and
RX33 is 1200k.

To boot from floppy type:

        >>> B/3 DUxy

where x is the controller number and y is device number.
You will now get up a prompt like

        >> NetBSD/vax boot [970610 23:44] <<
        :

At the prompt you type edlabel to label the disk, see below about
how to use it.
When labeling is finished, halt the computer, bring up the boot program
again and this time load copy, see below about how to use it.
Remember that you are will copy from partition 0 when using floppies.

Now go to step 3.


Installing over network:


You can use the same flags when booting over the net as when
booting from local disks; like: ">>>B/3 ESA0" will load boot
in ask state. From here you can load any file you want, even
copy and edlabel if they are located in the exported root fs.

Note 1: Netbooting of MicroVAX II/III systems with DEQNA/DELUA
    ethernet does not work does not work yet because lack of standalone
    drivers. Mounting of root and swap over NFS works goos though.
Note 2: Mopd won't work on VAXen with de/qe ethernet, due to the
    lack of bpf support for those interfaces.

Booting up miniroot.
When copying is ready, bring the boot program up a third
time, and this time bring up a real system by telling
boot where you put your miniroot _and_ also the generic
kernel name. Example: ra(0,1)gennetbsd,  boots gennetbsd
from swap partition on ra0.

When kernel is loaded, you will after a while get a
question about Root device?. Respond to this with
xx?*, where xx is the device name, ? is the unit
number and * tells that the system shall use the swap
partition as root partition. Example:

        Root device? ra0*

After that a second question:

        Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh:

Just type return. Now you will be in a normal single-user
shell, and it's just to newfs your partitions, and start installation.

A few things that you must remember to do from miniroot:
disklabel -B <diskname>  to install boot blocks.
MAKEDEV devices in the newly created root filesystem.
Copy gennetbsd and boot from miniroot filesystem
to the newly created root filesystem.

How to use edlabel:
Edlabel is a program to edit disklabels on any disks in a standalone
environment. Mostly it is used to set labels when doing initial
installation procedure. It is started from boot program prompt.
You will here be guided through a session, things with ^^^^ under
is typed in by the user, comments are within /* */.

	: edlabel
	  ^^^^^^^
With this program you can modify everything in the on-disk
disklabel. To do something useful you must know the exact
geometry of your disk, and have ideas about how you want
your partitions to be placed on disk. Some hints:
The a partition should be at least ~20000 blocks, the
b (swap) is depending on your use of the machine but it
should almost never be less than ~32000 blocks.

Disk geometry for most DEC disks can be found in the disktab
file, and applicable disk names can be found above.

Remember that disk names is given as disk(adapt, ctrl, disk, part)
when using the installation tools.

Label which disk? ra(1,0,0)     /* See INSTALL text for device types */

How to use copy:

Copy is a standalone program that can copy multiple volumes
from disk/tape to disk/tape. Mostly it is used to copy the 
miniroot filesystem onto the swap partition during initial
installation.
You will here be guided through a session, things with ^^^^ under
is typed in by the user, comments are within /* */.
This is an installation from TK50.


	>> NetBSD/vax boot [970610 23:44] <<
	: copy
	  ^^^^

copy: 
This program will read miniroot from tape/floppy/disk 
and install this miniroot onto disk.

Specify the device to read from as xx(N,0), where
xx is the device-name and N is the unit-number, e.g.
"mt(0,1)" for the first TMSCP-tape (TK50),
"ra(2,0)" for the third MSCP-disk/floppy (RX33/RX50)

device to read from ? mt(0,1) /* Tape 0, file 1 */
                      ^^^^^^^^
Specify number of blocks to transfer. Usually this is
sizeof(miniroot) / 512.
It's safe to transfer more blocks than just the miniroot.

number of blocks ? 4096  /* Miniroot size is 4096 block */
                   ^^^^
If your miniroot is split into volumes, then you must
specify the number of blocks per volume.
(e.g. 800 blocks per RX50, 2400 blocks per RX33)

number of blocks per volume ? [4096] 

Make sure unit tms(0,1) is online and holds the proper volume.
Then type 'g' to Go or 'a' to Abort.

OK to go on ? [g/a] g   /* g == go, a == abort */
                    ^
Reading ... Reading of miniroot done. (4096 blocks read)


Now specify the device to write miniroot to as xx(N,1)
where xx is the drive type and N is the drive number.
For example: ra(0,1) refers to MSCP drive #0, b partition

Root disk ? : ra(0,1) /* Actually DUA0, partition b (swap) */
              ^^^^^^^^^
Initializing partition ... done.
(4096 blocks written.)

Halt the machine and reboot from distribution media,
giving second partition as part to mount as root. Ex:
: ra(0,1) for ra disk 0, hp(2,1) for massbuss disk 2

Halt/Reboot the machine NOW.
