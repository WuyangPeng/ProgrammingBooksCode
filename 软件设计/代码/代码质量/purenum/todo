PURENUM "TO DO" LIST:

[MAJOR]

- create class Array:  dynamically resizes itself as new index ranges
  are accessed;  lowest array index can be nonzero, even negative;  accepts
  Int indexes of any size;  allows effortless insertions and deletions of
  values or ranges of values
- create class Integer_2c for high speeds on most standard computers
  (most computers have two's-complement ints which we can rely on for speed)
- add portable input/output (serialization) to class Int
- create class Number:  allows bignums with fractions
- create class Object:  a truely portable object format based on Number/Array
- create class Integer_x86 for high speeds on Intel-type hardware

[MINOR]

- add all of the standard C++ bitwise operations to class Int
- templatize the Array class to work with anything, not just Ints?
- optionally allow the Int interface to be in an abstract base class?
- add silent compression to Array?  would make Int * into Array illegal but
  would reduce array memory footprint almost down to regular int array size!
- add conversion operators from Int to int, float, double
- internationalize all of the string I/O functions?
- improve the speed of the wide math operations in several places
- create class Integer_fat for high speeds on wide bignums but huge code size
