CHANGELOG for DemoGL library.
-------------------------------------------

v1.31.0923. Released on: 23-sep-2001
-------------------------------------------
* dgl_dllmain.h
	- MODIFIED: 24 bit Z-buffer
* dgl_dlltexture.cpp
	- FIXED: the extension GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS in the 2 texture upload methods
		DoUploadCubeMap and DoUploadNormal was switched on AFTER the image data was uploaded.
		This is now fixed.
* DemoGL_Bass.h
	- ADDED: Definition of BASS_SYNC_POS.

* Documentation:
	- MODIFIED: the documentation of DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncCreate.

v1.31. Released on: 03-jun-2001
-------------------------------------------
* dgl_dlltexture.cpp/dgl_dlltexture.h
	These files have changed a lot. Include the new ones of v1.31 in your code (library developers)
	- ADDED: Compressed Texture support
	- ADDED: Cubemap support
	- ADDED: Hardware generated mipmap support (if available)

* dgl_dllbootutilfuncs.cpp:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: glFrustum was fed with floats. corrected.
	- FIXED: WS_EX_TOPMOST flag removed in CreateMainWindow()'s release build code.
	         The window will now not keep on top of the debugger. :)
  OTHER CHANGES:
	- Changed the default frustum to: glFrustum (-1.0, 1.0, -0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 20.0); 
	  in InitGL() so it now starts with the right proportions compared to the default 
	  screen size proportions: 4:3.
	- Moved ParseExtensionsString to CExtensions class.

* dgl_dllextensions.cpp/dgl_dllextensions.h
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: typo in extension GL_EXT_blend_subtract (that's without a second 's', Otis!). 
	         Old sourcecode will need a recompile with the new DemoGL_Extensions.h if you 
			 use this extension. Compiled executables will still work with the new v1.31 DLL.
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: ParseExtensionsString (moved from dgl_dllbootutilfuncs)
	- ADDED: Newest extensions from ATI and nVidia
  OTHER CHANGES:
	- Changed the crappy parsecode in ParseExtensionsString to a table based lookup 
	  tester. It's faster, smaller and better to maintain. It now doesn't update the 
	  screen when an extension is found and logged to prevent thread starvation 
	  (because the draw thread is flooded with WM_PAINT messages, which stalled nVidia drivers.)

* dgl_dllutilfuncs.h/dgl_dllutilfuncs.cpp:
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: new function: EffectuateVariable_VSYNC() that will switch VSYNC on or off depending
	         on the CDemoDat variable value. 2 routines were removed from the code and are now
			 instead calling this new function.
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_GetWindowSpecificHandles()
	- ADDED: new function: GenerateRegistryKeyName() that will generate the keyname used to read/store
	         values in the registry. It is stored in CDemoDat. The Load and save routines for registry values
			 for the startup dialog are now using the generated name instead of generating the name themselves.

  OTHER CHANGES:
	- Added new parameter to LogFeedback: bUpdateScreen. This has a default value of 'true' 
	  so no LogFeedback using code has to be be updated. 

* dgl_dlltextureutilfuncs.cpp/dgl_dlltextureutilfuncs.h:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: memleak from DEMOGL_TextureLoad(). Texture object was not deleted when loading 
		     of bitmap failed.
	- FIXED: DoDeleteTexture() routine sometimes didn't delete texture from OpenGL's 
	         texturespace
	- FIXED: Removed hardcoded dependancy of TextureID's to the lowerbound of 1. Now if the 
	         driver returns a set of TextureID's starting with X. If X>1, this will still 
			 result in proper functioning of the Texturemanager.
	- FIXED: Bad bind in 1D texture uploading code.
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapLoad();
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic();
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapUpdateWithFBRegion();
	- ADDED: new CPixelData class for the bitmap(s) of a texture object
	- ADDED: new routine: DoImportDDS();
  OTHER CHANGES:
	- Recoded some texture management functions to support TextureID's instead of names
	- Moved texture find/empty slot find code to 1 routine: GetFirstEmptySlotInTextureStore
	- Cleaned up internal usage of deprecated #defines. Now most #defines that are exported 
	  and which are also used internally are specified using their v1.3 name, prefixed with 
	  DGL_
	- Import routines for JPG/TGA/BMP are now using a CPixelData object instead of a CTexture 
	  object as storage of the bitdata loaded/converted.
	- Moved Upload/UnUpload routines to CTexture class.
	- Cleaned up DEMOGL_TextureDelete(). 
	- Added DDS (compressed textures) support to DEMOGL_TextureLoad();

* dgl_dlldemodat.h/dgl_dlldemodat.cpp:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: CDemoDat::SetOGLExtensions() now adds a space to the string to fix the bug that the
	         last extension sometimes wasn't found. (Because the parser is matching strings with a 
			 space added to the end).
	- FIXED: CDemoDat::SetbVSYNC() now calls new utilfunction EffectuateVariable_VSYNC().
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: a get/set pair methods for OGLMaxTextureSize(), which work on the new membervar 
	         m_iOGLMaxTextureSize.
	- ADDED: a get/set pair methods for TexNameTexIDDelta, which work on the new membervar 
	         m_iTexNameTexIDDelta.
	- ADDED: a get/set pair methods for RegistryKeyName, which work on thenew membervar
			 m_sRegistryKeyName.

* dgl_dllkernel.cpp:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: MainMsgHandler now calls EffectuateVariable_VSYNC instead of settig the VSYNC variable
	         itself.
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: the get call for the Max texture size and the storage of that size to 
	         WM_DEMOGL_INITSYSTEM message handler.

* dgl_dllstartsystem.cpp:
  ADDITIONS:
	- Added a call to GenerateRegistryKeyName() to all DoAppRun_* routines.
  OTHER CHANGES:
	- Changed some texts in InitSystem();

* dgl_dllstartupdialog.cpp/dgl_dllstartupdialog.h:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: frustum errors with rotating logo are now eliminated with a better scaling of the 
	         frustum in the about dialog.
	- FIXED: glFrustum was fed with floats. corrected.

* dgl_dllsysconsole.cpp:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: glOrtho was fed with floats and ints. corrected.

* DemoGL_Extensions.h
  FIXES:
  	- FIXED: typo in DGL_GL_EXT_blend_subtract.
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: newest declarations for all extensions supported by the latest nVidia and ATi chipsets
	         and drivers (including Geforce3's, as supported in Detonator v11.xx and v12.xx drivers)

* DemoGL_glext.h
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: all #defines and function headerdefinitions of all extensions supported by nVidia and
	         ATi chipsets and drivers. It's now the most complete glext.h available for OpenGL 
			 programmers, even more complete than ATi's or nVidia's.

* DemoGL_DLL.h:
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_GetWindowSpecificHandles()
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapLoad();
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic();
	- ADDED: new API method: DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapUpdateWithFBRegion();
	- ADDED: cubemap side #defines.

* Documentation:
  FIXES:
	- FIXED: language errors, typo's, bad sentences and other nasties
	- FIXED: layout errors in codesnippets resulted in all code on a single line.
	- FIXED: DEMOGL_TextureLoad() documentation was totally wrong.
  ADDITIONS:
	- ADDED: descriptions for the new API functions, plus descriptions for the new 
	         functionality in general
	- ADDED: Error codes plus descriptions of the textureloaders to reference manual.
