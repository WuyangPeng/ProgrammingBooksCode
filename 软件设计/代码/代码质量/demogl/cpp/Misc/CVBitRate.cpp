#include "Misc\CVBitRate.h"

/* ----------------------------------------------------------
   CFrameHeader class is used to retrieve a VBR's Header
   and load that into a usable structure.

   This code will be well commented, so that everyone can
   understand, as it's made for the public and not for
   private use, although private use is allowed. :)

   all functions specified both in the header and .cpp file
   will have explanations in both locations.
