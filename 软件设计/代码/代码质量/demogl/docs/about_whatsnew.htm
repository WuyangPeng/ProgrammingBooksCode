<h4>What's new in this version</h4>
<H3>Version 1.31.0923</H3>
Version 1.31.0923 contains a few bugfixes and uses the new Bass v1.1a musiclibrary. 
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><b>FIXED: mipmap generation</b>. Due to a bug hardware generated mipmaps were not created correctly and therefor
		not usable with GL_*_MIPMAP_* filter hints. This is fixed now.
	<LI><b>ADDED: MP3 position syncing</b>. Bass v1.1a includes MP3 position syncing. This has been included into the
		DemoGL soundsystem too. (See <a href="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncCreate.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncCreate</a>)
	<LI><b>MODIFIED: Z-buffer size</b>. The initial Z-buffer size was 32bits. This has been changed to 24 bits to make it
		easier for the wacky set of ATi Radeon drivers to decide correctly if they're able to support hardware acceleration.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Version 1.31</H3>
Version 1.31 contains some new features and several bugfixes and enhancements. Below is a list of the new features
and changes. Version 1.31 is fully backwards compatible with version 1.3, so you don't have to recompile your existing
executables.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><b>Cubemap support</b>. The texture manager of DemoGL now fully understands cubemaps. You can now use the
	    new API methods to include the usage of cubemaps in your OpenGL powered effects. Both static cubemaps
	    and dynamic cubemaps are supported.
	<LI><b>Compressed textures support</b>. The texture manager of DemoGL now loads and supports DDS files, which
	    contain compressed texturedata, compressed in the format DXT1, DXT3 or DXT5.
	<LI><b>Export of main window handles</b>. To use the wglFont* functions in OpenGL, you need the hWnd handle and
	    the hDC handle of the current window. DemoGL contains now a new API method that exports the hWnd and hDC of
	    the main window, which makes it very easy to create display lists from font glyphs using the wglFont* routines.
	<LI><b>Support for all new extensions</b>. The DemoGL SDK contains one of the most complete glext.h files available
	    and v1.31 comes with a new DemoGL_glext.h which contains declarations for all known new nVidia and ATi extensions, 
	    plus DemoGL includes detection and support for all these new extensions, so your code can check for these new
	    extensions easily via the DemoGL API methods.
	<LI><b>Hardware generated mipmaps</b>. When available in the OpenGL ICD, DemoGL will use the hardware to generate
	    mipmaps for all textures, if requested by the developer.
	<LI><b>Code enhancements</b>. The texture class is recoded and is now more flexible and more consistent and faster. The
	    extension detection code is recoded and the logging of the detected extensions is sped up dramatically so the startup
	    of an application is even faster than before. The main window of the DemoGL powered application is not made topmost
	    anymore, so when debugging a DemoGL powered application is now much easier, since the debugger window will not be
	    blocked by the application window.
	<LI><b>Bug fixes</b>. Some small things were enhanced, some memleaks and bugs were fixed. For a complete list see the
	    changelog in the sourcecode package.
	<LI><b>Compressed DLL</b>. The DemoGL DLL is now compressed with UPX, making the distributed DLL a lot smaller. 
	<LI><b>Updated documentation</b>. The documentation is updated with the new features plus the API reference manual
	    is re-checked for errors since some API method descriptions were complete wrong.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Version 1.3</H3>
Version 1.3 is a major new release of DemoGL with a lot of new functionality, new code, rewritten parts,
new better documentation and much more. The following sections summarize the new features.
<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Screensaver support</b>. Before, you could only create win32 applications with DemoGL, but now
		you can also create win32 screensavers with DemoGL, as a matter of fact, you can change a DemoGL
		powered win32 application into a win32 screensaver with a few lines of code.
	<li><b>New, adjustable console</b>. DemoGL v1.3 contains a new adjustable console which is customizable
		from code: a developer can adjust the size of the contentsbuffer, the amount of lines on screen and the
		screenwidth plus the console is now scrollable so no logged information is gone. It's now also rendered
		using vertexbuffers for optimal speed.
	<li><b>New soundsystem</b>. DemoGL v1.3 includes a total new soundsystem to produce music and soundeffects. 
		The new soundsystem is based on BASS v0.9 and can play MP3, mod/xm/it/s3m/mtm and wav files simultaneously
		using 2D and/or 3D logic and effects. DemoGL's API includes easy functions to control playback and to create
		synchronization callbacks. 
	<li><b>New kernel</b>. DemoGL v1.3's internal kernel is completely new. Using a better multithreaded boot-phase
		applications startup faster and run faster due to the better scheduling of tasks internally.
	<li><b>New, better structured API</b>. DemoGL v1.3's API is totally new. The old v1.2 API is still supported for
		backwards compatibility but not recommended for new applications. The new API contains a lot more functions
		and exposes a lot more functionality, making DemoGL even more flexible to use than v1.2.
	<li><b>New resolutions</b>. All common known resolutions are now supported, from 320x240 to 2048x1536 both full
		screen and windowed.
	<li><b>Better support for old hardware</b>. Allthough voodoo1 and voodoo2 are still unsupported, DemoGL contains
		now a setting to dynamically rescale large textures so voodoo3's and TNT cards will display textures that are
		larger than the maximum texture size supported by those cards.
	<li><b>New scriptcommands and parser</b>. DemoGL v1.3 contains support for a lot more scriptcommands and parameters.
		It is now possible to directly send integers and floats to an effect without having a string-to-int parser
		in the effectclass itself, plus the values can be given names so scripting of effects is made much easier
		and powerful. It's now also possible to loop demos by adding a simple command to the script, which can be
		handy in a multi-part screensaver that has to run on and on.
	<li><b>Easier debugging</b>. It's easier to debug your application by the adjustable overlay in debugmode plus the
		new logging functions in the new API. The overlay in debugmode, which is visible on top of the running effects
		and shows a part of the console contents, can now contain a custom amount of lines. It's now also possible
		to log lines using a printf style function of the DemoGL API.
	<li><b>New startup dialog</b>. DemoGL v1.3 contains a new startup dialog which is customizable with a custom graphic
		and contains much more adjustable settings than v1.2 and earlier. It also doesn't contain any DemoGL information
		besides a button to the about dialog of DemoGL. 
	<li><b>Custom startup dialog support</b>. It's now possible to create an own startup dialog and still be able to
		use DemoGL as if it was using its own startup dialog. The v1.3 API provides functions to determine specifics
		about the runtype (screensaver or not) and soundsystem so you can provide as much information and settings as
		DemoGL can with its own dialog.
	<li><b>Open Source</b>. DemoGL v1.3 is now Open Source, which means the sourcecode for the library is available
		for download. Developers can add custom functionality that wasn't implemented in DemoGL, remove non-used parts
		or simply study how DemoGL is constructed and how the system works internally. DemoGL v1.3 uses the 
		<a href="about_license.htm">BSD license</a> and contains approx 30,000 lines of C/C++ code.
	<li><b>And much more...</b>. DemoGL v1.3 contains a lot of small enhancements like a customizable progressbar for
		application loading, better messaging system for effects, bugfixes, tweaks, etc.
