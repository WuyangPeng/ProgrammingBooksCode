/**
*Base class for entire Visual Component Framework 
*New as of July 5,2001, Object will also support 
*refcounting for those who need this kind of support.
*There are several places in the ApplicationKit that will need to make use
*of this fairly soon. 
*Also Object supports a new technique for instantiating and destroying Object
*derived instances. In general, in C++, when creating a new 
*instance on the heap (free-store) you would use the operator new() function. This is
*being phased in the VCF for a variety of reasons, in favor of a new (no pun intended)
*scheme. New classes should hide their constructor's and destructor's, making 
*them private or protected. Proper object instantiation will now look like this:
<pre>
FooObject* f = FooObject::create();

//or if we needed to have a constructor that took an int...

FooObject* f = FooObject::create(12);
</pre>

*create() is a static method that will need to put on every class, and will be paired with 
*each constructor of the class. So if the class only needs a default constructor, then create() is 
*OK, if the class has a default constructor, a copy constructor, and a constructor that takes 
*a String, then there need to be 3 create() methods, create(), create( const class& ), and 
*create( String ), and so forth.
*
*The pattern for implementing create() is as follows:
*create the object on the heap via the operator new() call
*call the new created object's init() method, which is virtual 
*return the object to the caller.
*
*The init() method is intended to place common shared startup code. Because of the desire to 
*make it virtual it cannot be called in the constructor, thus the use of the create() call.
*init() does not have to be implemented.
*
*To facilitate this there will be macros that do just this declared in ClassInfo.h.
*These macros will allow for create() methods with up to six(6) arguments passed in
*The macros will NOT make the constructors for you, this is something that I think needs to 
*done by hand, and should be visible so that you can see what is going on. Using the Macros
*is optional. 
*
*Destroying the memory now happens in two ways: The first is the equivalent of the operator delete()
*call. This involves calling the objects free() method, which will call the virtual destroy() method 
*before calling operator delete() on itself;
*The second way an object can be destroyed is if it's refcount drops to 0, at which point the object's
*free() method will be invoked. Calling the object's release() method decrements the reference count 
*on the object.
*
*Like init(), destroy() is a virtual method, where common shared cleanup may take place, again
*due to the restrictions of C++, virtual methods are not allowed in destructors, but we get 
*around this with the free()/destroy() pattern.
*
*Semantics of the addRef/release usage are as follows:
*
*Note that this whole scheme is aimed at heap based objects. Many objects that are created on the stack
*do not need this, though if they have code in their init() method, this will have to be called.
