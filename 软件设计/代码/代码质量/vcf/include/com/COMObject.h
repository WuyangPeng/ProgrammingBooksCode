	*object parameter:
	*	The requested interface type first, followed by the base class for COM objects, followed
	*	by the "this" pointer. For example:
	*		<p><pre>			
	*			*object = (IDataObject*)(COMObject*)this;
	*		</pre></p>
	*
	*Further the class must declared as follows:
	*	Class name first, folowed by the public COM interfaces the class is supporting, followed by the 
	*	base COM Object class, and then any other framework interfaces that are being implemented.
	*	For example:
	*		<p><pre>
	*			class MyConnectionPoint : public IConnectionPoint, public COMObject {};
	*		</pre></p>
	*
	*	This ensures that the vtables C++ constructs, due to multiple inheritance, are done so correctly.
