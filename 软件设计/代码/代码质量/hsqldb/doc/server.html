<H2>hsqldb v.1.61 Client/Server Demo / Server</H2>
For this mode, both the server and the client must run as applications. They can 
be on the same computer, or on separate computers, but they must have access to 
each other over TCP/IP. Normally, this can be done only in a LAN (local area network) 
or WAN (wide area network), but not over the internet, because of security restrictions 
(for example firewalls). 
<P>
To test this mode, you need to start one server and one (or many)
clients, and then connect with the client(s) to the server.
<P>
<H3>How to start the server</H3>
There is a batch file provided in the demo directory. To start the application 
on Windows type: 
<P>
<CODE>runServer</CODE>
<P>
The server will consume this command window. To display 
the command line options of the Server, type:
<P>
<CODE>runServer -?</CODE>
<P>
After you have started the server, you can connect to it
by starting a client application (in a separate command window):
<P>
<CODE>run DatabaseManager</CODE>
<P>
Select 'Hypersonic SQL Server' and connect to the server.
<P>
<H3>How to stop the server</H3>
The server closes the database and stops automatically 
when the command 'SHUTDOWN' is executed.
To abort the server, press [Ctrl]+[C] (on Windows).
<P>
<H3>How to clean the database</H3>
The database will write to the files 'test.*'. If it is closed and started again, 
it will automatically reload the data. To get a a clean database, all 'test.*' 
files must be deleted.
