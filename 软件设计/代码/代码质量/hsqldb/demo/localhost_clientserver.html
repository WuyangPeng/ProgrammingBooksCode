<H2>HSQL Database Engine Client/Server Demo</H2>
<APPLET CODE="org.hsqldb.util.QueryTool" archive="hsqldb.jar" width="460" height="400" codebase="../lib/">
<PARAM NAME="database" VALUE="http://localhost">
</APPLET>

<H3>Client/server version</H3>
Currently, the applet is configured to connect to 'http://localhost',
but this can be changed in the source code of this HTML page:
The applet parameter 'database' is the path where the applet connects to.
Close the database and stop the WebServer using the 'SHUTDOWN' command.
<P>
<H2>If it does not work</H2>
On some browsers (Netscape 4.6?), the version compiled for
JDK 1.2 does not work. In the Java Console (Communicator
/ Extras / Java Console) you will get something like:
<P>
# Verifier error org/hsqldb/jdbcConnection.getTypeMap()Ljava/util/Map
<P>
This means the class java.util.Map was not found. In JDK 1.1,
this class does not exist. When compiled for 1.2, there is
a reference this class required to conform the JDBC 2.0 interface.
This class itself is never used, but the reference is required anyway.
It looks like most verifiers have no problem with this, but some
have.
<P>
The (only) solution for this problem is to recompile (at least the
client part) for JDK 1.1. You will need to install JDK 1.1 before
you can do this, then see:
