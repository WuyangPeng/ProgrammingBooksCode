/**  An interface which identifies an ArgoUML plug-in.
 *
 *   <dfn>Plug-ins</dfn> are specific modules which are replacements
 *   or additions to standard Argo classes.
 *   Argo references the plug-in functionality through interfaces which
 *   define the features of each type of plug-in.
 *
 *   This interface must be extended by another interface which is used
 *   to categorize the plugins.  An example of this is the
 *   <code>PluggableNotation</code> interface,
 *   which provides all the required functionality to request
 *   a notation generator of a notation dialect.
 *
 *   Argo will ask the <code>ModuleLoader</code>
 *   for a plug-in of a certain type.
 *   The loader will determine which plug-in to use and return a
 *   concrete class which implements that interface.
 *
 *   It is the intent of this class that any Argo feature that can be
 *   replaced or extended by this means be callable only by this means.

     *  which wants the PluggableMenu attached to as the context,
     *  so that it can determine that it would attach to a menu.  The

     *                 the plug-in type, but must be consistent
     *                 across that type.  The plug-in must want
     *                 to be exposed to all contexts.
