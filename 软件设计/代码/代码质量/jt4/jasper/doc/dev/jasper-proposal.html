<h4>by Craig McClanahan</h4>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The specification for JavaServer Pages<sup>TM</sup> (JSP) version 1.2 is
likely to require, among other things, exposing the internal structure of a
JSP page to custom tag libraries at page translation time.  This will require
some substantial changes to the existing Jasper code base, and offers us the
opportunity to improve its internal organization and functionality.
Prior to undertaking these efforts, it is appropriate for us to discuss
and agree on the high level goals we wish to achieve, and the proposed overall
architecture of the new code.</p>

<p>This document proposes a set of goal statements, along with related
assumptions and implications, for the purpose of gaining consensus and
agreement at a high level.  It also includes a first cut at an overall
architecture (subject to change if the goals change during the process of
consensus building)</p>

<p>Jasper is, and is proposed to remain, the component of Tomcat that compiles
and executes JSP pages.  If the proposal on source code organization is also
accepted, it will live in a "jasper" subdirectory of the new
<code>jakarta-tomcat-4.0</code> CVS module.</p>


<h2>High Level Goals for Next Generation Jasper</h2>

<p>The statements in the following sections describe goals by which we can
measure the completeness and success of the efforts to develop the next
major version of the JSP page compiler and runtime environment currently known
as Jasper.</p>


<h3>Specification Compliance</h3>

<p>The result of this coding effort will support 100% of the required
functionality described in the JSP 1.2 specification (to be available as
an initial public draft fairly soon), as well as the relevant portions of
the Servlet 2.3 specification (to be available at the same time).</p>
<ul>
<li>The means by which specification conformance is tested shall include
    passing 100% of the JSP tests in the <strong>jakarta-watchdog</strong> test
    suite, as it is evolved to include tests for all the new features.</li>
<li>The servlet and JSP API classes against which Jasper is compiled and
    executed shall be the most current version of the API classes for
    JSP 1.2 and Servlet 2.3 that have been checked in to the
    <strong>jakarta-servletapi</strong> repository while these specifications
    are in public review.  After the specifications are final, the final
    versions of the API classes, as amended for any formally adopted errata
    on the specifications after the are final, will be utilized.</li>
<li>In addition, Jasper shall provide a web application containing unit tests
    to validate the functionality of its own behavior, above and beyond the
    specification requirements.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Compiler Environment and Requirements</h3>

<p>The JSP page compiler component of Jasper shall operate in the following
environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>It shall be possible to execute the JSP page compiler, and produce the
    corresponding servlet classes representing these pages, from a command
    line application (currently <code>jspc</code>), without having to be
    executed within a servlet container.</li>
<li>It shall be possible to embed the JSP page compiler as a servlet in any
    servlet container conforming to the Servlet 2.3 Specification (not just
    Tomcat).  Among other things, this implies that there shall be no internal
    code dependencies within Jasper on any classes in the
    <code>org.apache.tomcat.*</code> package hierarcy.</li>
<li>When embedded as a servlet, the JSP page compiler shall support both
    on-demand page compilation (when it detects that the source code of a
    page has been changed) or on-request page compilation (based on the
    reserved precompilation request URIs described in the JSP 1.2
    specification).</li>
<li>When embedded as a servlet, the JSP page compiler shall support
    optional compilation of JSP pages in the entire web application, or within
    designated portions of the context-relative URI space, in response to
    an "application startup" event.</li>
<li>It shall be feasible for servlet containers (such as Tomcat) to support
    mechanisms for improved performance of the JSP page compiler that depend
    on internal knowledge of the JSP page compiler and its classes if it
    chooses to do so.  Therefore, the key features and integration points
    of the JSP page compiler shall be exposed through interfaces that can
    remain stable across enhancements to the Jasper code base.</li>
<li>It shall be possible to embed the JSP page compiler inside a development
    tool in such a way that JSP pages can be translated on request from within
    that tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>The JSP page compiler component of Jasper shall support the following
high level functional capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The compiler shall accept input pages in either the JSP syntax or the
    XML syntax, as described by the JSP 1.2 Specification.</li>
<li>It shall be possible to use the appropriate portions of the compiler
    (principally the parser) to build a tool that translates a page in
    JSP syntax into a corresponding page using the XML syntax.</li>
<li>When executed in a stand-alone environment, or from within a development
    tool, the JSP page compiler shall include the optional ability to generate
    elements to be included in the web application deployment descriptor
    (<code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) of the web application in which these
    servlets will be included.</li>
<li>When executed from within a servlet container, the JSP page compiler
    shall support the option to retain intermediate versions of the translated
    source code (such as the internal XML representation and the Java source
    code representation) after translation is complete.</li>
<li>The JSP page compiler shall support configurable properties and plugins
    for customizing its functionality, including (but not limited to):
    <ul>
    <li>The mechanism by which Java class names for the generated servlet
        are created.</li>
    <li>The package name into which generated servlets are placed.</li>
    <li>The processing performed for scriptlets, so that languages other than
        Java can be used.  The standard Jasper page compiler shall support
        Java language scriptlets.</li>
    <li>The Java compiler to be used for translating Java source code into
        the corresponding servlet class file.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<li>The JSP page compiler shall support the optional generation of debugging
    information (such as line and column numbers) that will assist the runtime
    environment in identifying error locations in the original JSP page.
    Initially, this debugging information shall be similar to that generated
    by Jasper in Tomcat 3.2; however, once the JSR-045 specification (related
    to adding debugging information to Java class files for non-Java languages)
    is available in public draft, it shall be possible to configure the
    generation of debugging information in this format as well.</li>
<li>The JSP page compiler shall support the ability to generate servlets
    that extend a developer-provided superclass (rather than the default one
    available in the runtime support classes included with Jasper), as
    required by the JSP 1.2 specification.  However, the organization of the
    generated servlet code, and associated runtime support classes, should be
    optimized for the case where the default superclass will be utilized.</li>
<li>To the maximum degree feasible, translation errors shall be reported
    in terms of line and column numbers from the original JSP source page,
    rather than line numbers in the generated servlet.</li>
<li>The JSP page compiler shall generate servlets that conform to all of the
    requirements described below in section "Runtime Environment and
    Requirements."</li>
</ul>


<h3>Runtime Environment and Requirements</h3>

<p>The servlet classes produced by the JSP page compiler (no matter which
mode the compiler itself was executed in) shall operate in the following
environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The generated servlet classes may depend on runtime support classes that
    are specific to Jasper.  These runtime support classes shall be available
    in a JAR file that can be included in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>
    directory of a web application in which the generated servlet classes
    will be executed, or made available as server extensions by whatever means
    are supported by the servlet container they are deployed into.
<li>It shall be possible to deploy the generated servlet classes, and the
    associated runtime support classes described above, on any servlet
    container conforming to the Servlet 2.3 Specification (not just Tomcat).
    Among other things, this implies that there shall be no internal code
    dependencies in the generated servlet classes, or the runtime support
    classes, on any classes in the <code>org.apache.tomcat.*</code>
    package hierarchy.</li>
<li>It shall be feasible for servlet containers (such as Tomcat) to support
    mechanisms for improved performance of the generated servlets that depend
    on internal knowledge of the JSP page compiler, the servlet classes that
    it generates, and the runtime support classes, if it chooses to do so.
    Therefore, key features and integration points of the generated servlet
    classes and runtime support classes shall be exposed through interfaces
    that can remain stable across enhancements to the Jasper code base.</li>
<li>The generated servlet classes shall have no runtime dependencies on any
    classes in the JSP page compiler.  It shall be possible to run them in
    a web application where all JSP pages have been precompiled, and no
    runtime JSP page compilation is available.  It shall also be possible
    to run them (and recompile them if necessary) in an environment where
    runtime JSP page compilation is available.</li>
<li>The generated servlet classes shall operate under the class loader and
    security domain (if any) established by the servlet container in which
    they are deployed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The servlet classes produced by the JSP page compiler (no what what
environment it was executed in) shall support the following high level
functional capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>To the maximum degree feasible, runtime exceptions shall be reported
    in terms of line and column numbers from the original JSP source page,
    rather than line numbers in the generated servlet.</li>
<li>Stack traces produced in response to translation or runtime errors may
    be logged (via <code>ServletContext.log()</code>), but shall not be
    reported back to clients whose requests triggered the errors.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Overall Architecture Proposal</h2>

<p>The following diagram contains the first cut at an overall architecture
for the next generation Jasper compiler, taking into account the goals
described earlier.</p>

<p><strong>FIXME - image containing the architecture diagram</strong></p>

<p>As you can see, the compiler is divided into several phases, with the
functionality described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parser</strong> - Accept as input a page in either JSP syntax or
    XML syntax, as described by the specification.  Produce as output a DOM
    view of the underlying page, as well as related source file debugging
    information that can be passed along to be included in the servlet class
    that is ultimately generated.</li>
<li><strong>Transformer</strong> - Accept as input the DOM and debugging
    information provided by the Parser, and support the translation time
    transformations described in the JSP 1.2 specification.  The output will
    be a revised DOM tree (transformed in place?) and revised debugging
    information.</li>
<li><strong>Generator</strong> - Accept as input the (possibly transformed
    and validated) DOM and debugging information from the Transformer, and
    generate the source code for a Java servlet that implements the desired
    functionality of the JSP page.</li>
<li><strong>Translator</strong> - Accept as input the Java servlet produced
    by the Generator, and compile it with the configured Java compiler to
    produce a servlet class file for this page.</li>
<li><strong>Deployer</strong> - If this page is being compiled in a stand
    alone environment, the Deployer phase can be invoked to produce the
    appropriate additions to the web application deployment descriptor
    (<code>web.xml</code>), and a JAR file containing the compiled page
    classes, to be included in a web application.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following points should be kept in mind when considering how to
implement the phases described above:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first blush, it would appear that the Parser could use a standard
    JAXP-compatible DOM parser (with validation enabled) when reading XML
    input.  However, this will not be feasible for the following reasons:
    <ul>
    <li>Any JSP page (in XML syntax) that uses custom tag libraries will
        not be possible to validate, because the custom tag attributes
        themselves are not available in the DTD of the JSP page itself.</li>
    <li>If you use a non-validating DOM parser, there is no access to source
        line and column number information.
    </ul>
    Therefore, it appears that we should implement two parser front ends
    (one for each syntax) that generate SAX events, and build a common parser
    back end that produces the DOM and debugging information to be handed on
    to the Transformer.</li>
<li>The front end for JSP syntax can be based on the existing parser code in
    Jasper, after modifying to produce output in the expected format.</li>
<li>It should be easy to add a command-line tool that takes the DOM as input
    and produces a page source file (in XML syntax) as output.  This would be
    useful for developers who wish to switch from JSP syntax to XML syntax
    without having to manually recode all of their pages.</li>
<li>The Transformer phase will also likely support the concept of validators
    that examine the DOM of the page for consistency with application
    standards.  Therefore, it can also cause fatal translation time errors.
    </li>
<li>Since we are not using a validating XML parser for the reasons described
    above, we should consider using an internal validator at this stage to
    check for "validity" of the DOM in the XML sense (proper nesting of
    elements, no unknown attributes, and so on).</li>
<li>The Generator should be able to produce debugging information that is
    similar to that produced by the current version of Jasper, for backwards
    compatibility.  In addition, it should track with the published results
    of JSR 45, under which original line number information for any language
    being translated into Java will be optionally included in the class file
    itself.</li>
<li>At a minimum, the Translator phase should support Jikes and the built in
    Java compiler from the JDK (as is supported by the current version of
    Jasper).  To the maximum degree feasible, we should also support plug in
    of different Java compilers through some appropriate interface.</li>
<li>Deployer support is something that can be done in a minimal fashion early
    on (similar to what <code>jspc</code> does now), but I envision enhanced
    capabilities in this area being added later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it is too early for detailed source code design, I would suggest
that the source modules for each phase of the JSP page compiler be organized
into a separate Java package (such as <code>org.apache.jasper.generator</code>
for the Java code generation phase).  Interfaces that describe cross-phase
information flows can be defined in the <code>org.apache.jasper</code>
package, with implementations provided by the phase that actually produces
that information.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, the runtime support classes that a generated page
may depend on should be organized into a single Java package (such as
<code>org.apache.jasper.runtime</code>), to facilitate easy packaging as a
JAR file, and to discourage dependencies on other Jasper internals.</p>
