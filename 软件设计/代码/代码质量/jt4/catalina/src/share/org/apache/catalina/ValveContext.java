/**
 * <p>A <b>ValveContext</b> is the mechanism by which a Valve can trigger the
 * execution of the next Valve in a Pipeline, without having to know anything
 * about the internal implementation mechanisms.  An instance of a class
 * implementing this interface is passed as a parameter to the
 * <code>Valve.invoke()</code> method of each executed Valve.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</strong>: It is up to the implementation of
 * ValveContext to ensure that simultaneous requests being processed (by
 * separate threads) through the same Pipeline do not interfere with each
 * other's flow of control.</p>
