<h1>5. Development Processes</h1>

<p>Although application development can take many forms, this manual proposes
a fairly generic process for creating web applications using Tomcat.  The
following sections highlight the commands and tasks that you, as the developer
of the code, will perform.  The same basic approach works when you have
multiple programmers involved, as long as you have an appropriate source code
control system and internal team rules about who is working on what parts
of the application at any given time.

<p>The task descriptions below assume that you will be using CVS for source
code control, and that you have already configured access to the appropriate
CVS repository.  Instructions for doing this are beyond the scope of this
manual.  If you are using a different source code control environment, you
will need to figure out the corresponding commands for your system.


<!-- 5.1 Create -->
<a name="Create"></a>
<h2>5.1 Create Project Source Directory</h2>

<p>The first step is to create a new project source directory, and customize
the <code>build.xml</code> and build script you will be using.  The directory
structure is described in <a href="source.html">Section 4</a>, or you can
use the <a href="sample" target="_new">sample</a> application as a starting
point.

<p>Create your project source directory, and define it within your CVS
repository.  This might be done by a series of commands like this, where
<code>{project}</code> is the name under which your project should be
stored in the CVS repository, and {username} is your login username:
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	mkdir myapp	<-- Assumed "project source directory"
	cd myapp
	mkdir etc
	mkdir lib
	mkdir src
	mkdir web
	cvs import -m "Initial Project Creation" {project} \
		{username} start
</pre>

<p>Now, to verify that it was created correctly in CVS, we will perform a
checkout of the new project:
<pre>
	cd ..
	mv myapp myapp.bu
	cvs checkout {project}
</pre>


<p>Next, you will need to create and check in an initial version of the
<code>build.xml</code> and <code>build</code> or <code>build.bat</code>
script to be used for development.  You can base <code>build.xml</code> on the
<a href="build.xml.txt" target="_new">basic build.xml file</a>,
or code it from scratch.
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	cd myapp
	emacs build.xml		<-- if you want a real editor :-)
	cvs add build.xml
	emacs build		<-- or build.bat on Windows
	chmod +x build		<-- on Unix, make it executable
	cvs add build		<-- or build.bat on Windows
	cvs commit
</pre>

<p>So far, all the editing you've done to the <code>build.xml</code> file,
and the corresponding build script, is local to your development directory.
Committing the changes makes them visible to other developers.

<p>Now, create the initial version of the web application deployment
descriptor.  You can base <code>web.xml</code> on the
<a href="web.xml.txt" target="_new">basic web.xml file</a>,
or code it from scratch.
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	cd myapp/etc		<-- Ultimate destination will be WEB-INF
	emacs web.xml
	cvs add web.xml
	cvs commit
</pre>


<!-- 5.2 Configure -->
<a name="Configure"></a>
<h2>5.2 Configure Tomcat To Recognize Your Application</h2>

<p>In order for Tomcat to recognize your application, you must integrate
it as described in <a href="deployment.html#Integration">Section 3.4</a>.
Any of the proposed techniques can be used.  For our purposes, we will assume
that you are using the first approach (unpacked hierarchy), because we set
the deployment home to be an appropriate directory under the
<code>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps</code> directory.  With multiple developers, it
is easiest to install Tomcat separately for each of them, so that they can
have their own CATALINA_HOME (as well as start and stop Tomcat) independently.


<!-- 5.3 Edit -->
<a name="Edit"></a>
<h2>5.3 Edit Source Code and Pages</h2>

<p>The edit/build/test tasks will generally be your most common activities
during development and maintenance.  The following general principles apply.
As described in <a href="source.html">Section 4</a>, newly created
source files should be located in the appropriate subdirectory, under your
project source directory.

<p>Whenever you wish to refresh your development directory to reflect the
work performed by other developers, you will ask CVS to do it for you:
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	cd myapp
	cvs update -d		<-- -d means create dirs if necessary
</pre>

<p>To create a new file, go to the appropriate directory, create the file,
and register it with CVS.  When you are satisfied with it's contents (after
building and testing is successful), commit the new file to the repository.
For example, to create a new JSP page:
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	cd myapp/web		<-- Ultimate destination is document root
	emacs mypage.jsp
	cvs add mypage.jsp
	... build and test the application ...
	cvs commit
</pre>

<p>Java source code that is defined in packages should be organized in a
directory hierarchy (under the <b>src/</b> subdirectory) that matches the
package names.  For example, a Java class named
<code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyClass.java</code> should be stored in file
<code>src/com/mycompany/mypackage/MyClass.java</code> under your project
source directory.  Whenever you create a new subdirectory, don't forget to
register it with CVS.

<p>To edit an existing source file, you will generally just start editing
and testing, then commit the changed file when everything works.  Although
CVS can be configured to required you to "check out" or "lock" a file you
are going to be modifying, this is generally not used.


<!-- 5.4 Build -->
<a name="Build"></a>
<h2>5.4 Build The Web Application</h2>

<p>When you are ready to compile the application, issue the following
commands (generally, you will want a shell window open that is set to
the project source directory, so that only the last command is needed):
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	cd myapp		<-- Normally leave a window open here
	build			<-- (Windows) Defaults to "build compile"
	./build.sh		<-- (Unix) Defaults to "build compile"
</pre>

<p>The Ant tool will be utilized to compile any new or updated Java code.
If this is the first time you compile after a "build clean", it will cause
everything to be recompiled.

<p>To force the recompilation of your entire application, do this instead:
<pre>
	cd {my home directory}
	cd myapp
	build all                <-- (Windows)
        ./build.sh all           <-- (Unix)
</pre>

<p>This is a very good habit immediately before checking in changes, to
make sure that you have not introduced any subtle problems that Javac's
conditional checking did not catch.


<!-- 5.5 Test -->
<a name="Test"></a>
<h2>5.5 Test Your Web Application</h2>

<p>To test your application, you will want to execute it under Tomcat.
Assuming you have integrated your application as described earlier, this
is very simple.  Under Unix, simply execute:
<pre>
	$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh
</pre>

<p>or, under Windows, execute:
<pre>
	%CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup
</pre>

<p>This command starts Tomcat as a background process.  Now, point your
web browser at the home page for your application, by opening the following
URL (where "/myapp" is the context path you have assigned to it):
<pre>
	http://localhost:8080/myapp
</pre>

<p>Now, you can exercize your application to verify that it operates
correctly.  When you discover something that needs to change, fix it as
follows:
<ul>
<li>To change a JSP page, modify it in the <b>source</b> directory and
    then re-execute the <code>build</code> script.  The updated
    page will be recopied, and Tomcat will recognize this the next time
    that page is accessed -- the page will then be recompiled automatically.
<li>Changing a servlet or other Java class is similar, but the effort
    required depends on whether you selected the "autoreload" attribute
    for this context when you integrated with Tomcat.  First, edit the
    file in its <b>source</b> directory, and re-execute the
    <code>build</code> script.  The updated Java class will be recompiled.
    If autoreloading is selected, Tomcat will notice this change the next
    time this class is referenced, and will automatically unload and reload
    your application.  Otherwise, you will need to manually stop and restart
    Tomcat before continuing.
</ul>

<p>Using a debugger on servlets and JSP pages is currently outside the scope
of this document.  Enhancements to describe these procedures is requested.

<p>Do not forget to commit your changes to the source code repository when
you have completed your testing!


<!-- 5.6 Deploy -->
<a name="Deploy"></a>
<h2>5.6 Deploy Your Web Application</h2>

<p>When you are through adding new functionality, and you've tested everything
(you DO test, don't you :-), it is time to create the distributable version
of your web application that can be deployed on the production server.  The
following general steps are required:
<ul>
<li>Issue the command <code>build all</code> from the project source
    directory, to rebuild everything from scratch one last time.
<li>Issue the command <code>build dist</code> to create a distributable
    web application archive (WAR) file, as well as a JAR file containing
    the corresponding source code.
<li>Give the WAR file to the system administrator of your production
    server environment, so that he or she can install it.
</ul>
