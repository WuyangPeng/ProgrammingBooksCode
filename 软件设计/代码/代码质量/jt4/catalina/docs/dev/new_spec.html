<title>Implementation of New Servlet 2.3 Features</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<a href="README.html">Home</a>

<p>This document summarizes the current implementation state of the new
features of the Servlet 2.3 draft specification in Catalina.  To give a
quick synopsis of the completion state of each new feature, we're
using a "how would you like your steak" metaphor.  Apologies to all the
vegetarians out there!</p>

<h2>Application Events [Medium Well]</h2>

<p>You can now register event listeners in the web.xml file that receive
notification when the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application startup</li>
<li>Application shutdown</li>
<li>New, replaced, or removed application (servlet context) attributes</li>
<li>Session created</li>
<li>Session invalidated or timed out</li>
<li>New, replaced, or removed session attributes</li>

<p>Application listener functionality has been added to Catalina, and seems to
work fairly well.  There are two listeners in the "examples" web application
that simply log things with ServletContext.log() to show that they were
reached.</p>

<h2>Servlet Filters [Medium Rare]</h2>

<p>You can now register Filters in the web.xml file that are the application
level analogue to Valves in the Catalina core.  Filters have the following
general features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filters can be mapped to either URL patterns or particular servlets</li>
<li>Filters can pre-process and post-process requests and responses</li>
<li>Filters can wrap the request and/or response objects that are passed on
    (so you can do content type transformations, for example)</li>
<li>Filters can respond to a request and return, instead of passing the request
    on (for example, you can do authentication challenges at the app level)
    </li>

<p>Related to this, servlets can now do the same sort of wrapping when they
pass arguments to a RequestDispatcher.  Previously, you were required to
pass the original request and response objects received from the container.</p>

<p>Servlet filter functionality has been added to Catalina, and lightly tested,
although wrapping has not been thoroughly tested yet.  There is a filter in
the "examples" application that is set up as both path mapped and servlet
mapped to the invoker servlet ("/servlet/*"), which stores a request attribute
that is passed on to the servlet that is ultimately executed.</p>

<h2>Dependencies on Installed Extensions [Raw]</h2>

<p>Web applications, or the JAR files in the WEB-INF/lib directory, can now
declare their dependence on particular versions of external libraries that
may be provided by the container as shared extensions.  No work has been
done to implement this capability in Catalina yet.</p>

<h2>Internationalization Fixes [Medium Rare]</h2>

<p>Catalina now supports mapping Locales to character sets, and the new
setCharacterEncoding() method on ServletRequest.  Much more testing and
enhancement is needed in this area.</p>

<h2>Web Application Classloader [Medium Well]</h2>

<p>Section 9.6.2 of the Servlet Spec draft describes requirements and
suggestions related to the classloader provided to a web application.
These requirments are currently followed in Catalina.</p>

<h2>DTD for Servlet 2.3 Application Deployment Descriptor [Medium]</h2>

<p>An unofficial version of the DTD for parsing web.xml files is included in
Catalina (in the source repository it is at "catalina/src/conf/web_23.dtd").
It will be replaced by the official version when published.</p>
