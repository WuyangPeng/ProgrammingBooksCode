<h2>What is Catalina?</h2>

<p>Catalina is the reference implementation of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet">Servlet API specification</a>.
It is packaged in Tomcat along with Jasper (the reference implementation of
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages (JSP)
specification</a>.</p>

<p>Catalina will also run servlets that conform to the Servlet API
specification separately from Jasper.  It has no internal code dependencies
on Jasper, although Tomcat as a whole includes some code that optimizes
performance when Catalina and Jasper are in fact deployed together.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The Catalina code base has a fairly long lifetime (stretching back to
when it was going to be the next version of Apache JServ).  Current efforts
are primarily focused on integrating the new features requried by version 2.3
of the spec (which just entered public draft status), adding the last
remaining bits of functionality present in Tomcat 3.x but not yet in Catalina
(support for web server connectors and the ability to run a web application
under a security policy), and improving performance.  The following
documents provide a more detailed look at what's going on.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="new_spec.html">Implementation of New Servlet 2.3 Features</a> -
    Summary of the key new features of the Servlet 2.3
    draft specification, and describes progress towards implementing them
    in Catalina.</li>
<li><a href="todo.html">Catalina TODO List</a> - List of the
    high level tasks that need to be completed for Catalina, and includes the
    names and email addresses of folks who have volunteered to work on the
    various pieces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The following documents describe the internal architecture of Catalina
in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="proposal.html">Original Proposal for Catalina</a> -
    The original document that proposed the Catalina architecture, including
    design goals and an overview of the primary components.</li>
<li><a href="architecture.html">Architecture of Catalina</a> -
    High level overview of the current major components of Catalina,
    and how they interact with each other.</li>
<li><a href="building.html">Building Catalina</a> - Summary of the software
    prerequisites and steps required to build Catalina (as well as integrate
    it with Jasper and the example webapps if you want to) using the
    Tomcat 4.0 source distribution (or a CVS checkout of this code).</li>
<!--
<li><a href="../../../../build/catalina/javadoc/index.html">JavaDocs</a> -
    The JavaDoc for all internal Catalina classes (once you have generated
    it with the "javadoc" build target).</li>
-->
</ul>
