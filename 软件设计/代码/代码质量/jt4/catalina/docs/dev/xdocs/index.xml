<section name="The Catalina Servlet Container">


  <p><strong>Catalina</strong> is the servlet container portion of
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Tomcat 4.0</a>.  It
  implements the Servlet Specification, version 2.3 (Proposed Final
  Draft 2), which is available for download
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The navigation links to the left take you to portions of the
  Catalina documentation that is interesting to developers working on
  enhancing (or fixing bugs in) Tomcat.  In addition, you will find
  the source code of the project to be liberally commented and easy
  to follow, once you become familiar with the overall architecture.</p>
