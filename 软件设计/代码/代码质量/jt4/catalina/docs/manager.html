<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Tomcat ships with a web application (by default installed at context
path <code>/manager</code>) that facilitates installing, starting, stopping,
removing, listing information, and reloading (that is, forcing a reload of
all class files without removing the application from service) of other web
applications that are running in the same virtual host as the Manager
application itself.
This application is suited to scripted operation, because it can be executed
from any client program that can issue HTTP requests.  As such, it is
complementary to other administrative applications that have a more
human-oriented user interface.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong> - As of the Tomcat 4.0 milestone 2 release, there
is a bug in the operation of the "install" command that prevents installing,
removing, and then reinstalling an application from the same URL for a
web application archive (WAR) file.  To work around this, either reinstall
the application from a different WAR file URL, or install from an unpacked
directory (on the same server that Tomcat is running on).</p>

<a name="Commands"></a>
<h3>Available Commands</h3>

<p>The Manager application servlet responds to action requests that are encoded
as the extra path information, and request parameters, of HTTP requests made to
the manager application.  The following command descriptions assume that you
have installed the Manager application on context path <code>/manager</code>
on your local host installation of Tomcat.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/install?path=/xxx&amp;war=yyy</b> -
    Install the web application whose WAR file (or directory containing the
    unpacked application) is present at URL <code>yyy</code>, and attach it
    to context path <code>/xxx</code>.  See below for valid syntax options
    for the web applcation archive URl.  If the URL of an actual WAR file
    is specified, the WAR will be automatically expanded into a directory
    underneath the application base for this virtual host.</li>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/list</b> - List the context paths
    of all currently installed web applications for this virtual host.
    Each context will be listed with the following format
    <code>path:status:sessions</code>.  Where path is the context
    path. Status is either running or stopped. Sessions is the number of
    active Sessions.</li>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/reload?path=/xxx</b> - Cause the web
    application installed at context path <code>/xxx</code> to reload all its
    associated Java classes, even if automatic reloading is disabled.</li>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/remove?path=/xxx</b> - Cause the web
    application installed at context path <code>/xxx</code> to be gracefully
    shutdown and delete the web application directory and files.</li>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/sessions?path=/xxx</b> - List session
    information about the web application attached to context path
    <code>/xxx</code> for this virtual host.</li>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/start?path=/xxx</b> - Start the web
    application attached to context path <code>/xxx</code> for this
    virtual host.</li>
<li><b>http://localhost:8080/manager/stop?path=/xxx</b> - Stop the web
    application attached to context path <code>/xxx</code> for this
    virtual host.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <code>path=/</code> for the ROOT context.</p>
<p>The syntax of the URL for a web application archive must conform to one
of the following patterns to be successfully installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>file:/absolute/path/to/a/directory</b> - You can specify the absolute
    path of a directory that contains the unpacked version of a web
    application.  This directory will be attached to the context path you
    specify without any changes.</li>
<li><b>jar:file:/absolute/path/to/a/warfile.war!/</b> - You can specify a
    URL to a local web application archive file.  The syntax must conform to
    the rules specified by the <code>JarURLConnection</code> class for a
    reference to an entire JAR file.</li>
<li><b>jar:http://hostname:port/path/to/a/warfile.war!/</b> - You can specify
    a URL to a remote (HTTP-accessible) web application archive file.  The
    syntax must conform to the rules specified by the
    <code>JarURLConnection</code> class for a reference to an entire
    JAR file.</li>
</ul>

<p>For ease of script processing, the response generated by the Manager
application servlet is rendered with content type <code>text/plain</code>.
The first line of the response starts with "OK - " or "FAIL - " depending
on whether the requested operation was successful or not, followed by a
descriptive summary of the operation that took place, or the error that
prevented the requested operation from taking place.</p>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Obviously, the Manager application can have significant impacts on a
running instance of Tomcat.  Therefore, it should not be (and is not) enabled
by default.  The following security considerations apply to this application.
<ul>
<li>By default, the manager application is restricted by a security constraint
    that looks for users with an assigned role of <code>manager</code>.  There
    are no such users in the default
    <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code> file, so by default no
    one can execute any of the commands supported by the Manager application.
    </li>
<li>The Manager application servlet will refuse to initialize itself if it is
    invoked by the invoker servlet (via a context relative path like
    <code>/servlet/org.apache.catalina.servlets.ManagerServlet</code>).  You
    <strong>MUST</strong> install a <code>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</code>
    element in a web application deployment descriptor (or use the default
    web application shipped with Tomcat) to use this functionality.
<li>You <strong>SHOULD</strong> ensure that the Manager application is always
    protected by a security constraint so that user login is required.  To
    facilitate scripting, the default login configuration for the Manager
    application uses HTTP BASIC authentication, because client programs can
    easily determine the content of the <code>Authorization</code> header they
    should send, once the assigned username and password are known.</li>
</ul>
