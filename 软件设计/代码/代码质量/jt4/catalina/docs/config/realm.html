<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A <strong>Realm</strong> component represents a mechanism by which a
"database" of usernames, passwords, and their associated security roles can
be linked into Catalina, for the purpose of authenticating users and validating
security constraints.  A variety of standard implementations is available,
or you can implement your own to customize Tomcat's behavior to utilize your
own security infrastructure.</p>

<p>If you attach a <strong>Realm</strong> to an outer Container (such as an
<strong>Engine</strong>, that Realm will be used for all nested Containers
(<strong>Host</strong> and <strong>Context</strong> components), unless you
specifically nest a different Realm inside the nested Container.  If you are
using the Single Sign On capability (see <a href="#Special Features">Special
Features</a>), you <strong>must</strong> share a Realm at either the
Engine or Host level.</p>

<br>


<a name="Common Attributes"></a>
<h2>Common Attributes</h2>

<p>All implementations of the <strong>Realm</strong> component support the
following attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>className</code></td>
    <td>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.Realm</code> interface.
        Because there is no single standard implementation, this attribute
        is required.  See <a href="#Standard Implementation Attributes">
        Standard Implementation Attributes</a> for the names of the
        supported classes.
    </td>
  </tr>

<a name="Standard Implementation Attributes"></a>
<h2>Standard Implementation Attributes</h2>

<p>Unlike most other Catalina components, there is not a single standard
implementation of the <strong>Realm</strong> component available.  Instead,
a variety of standard implementations are available for your use.  To select
one, use the specified value for the <code>className</code> attribute, and
configure the remaining attributes as described below.</p>


<a name="JDBCRealm"></a>
<h3> JDBC Database Realm (<code>org.apache.catalina.realm.JDBCRealm</code>)</h3>

<p>The <strong>JDBC Database Realm</strong> connects Catalina to a relational
database, accessed through an appropriate JDBC driver, to perform lookups of
usernames, passwords, and their associated roles.  Because the lookup is done
each time it is required, changes to the database will be immediately reflected
in the information used to authenticate new logins.  A rich set of
configuration attributes lets you customize the database to which Catalina will
connect, as well as the names of relevant tables and columns within the
database that contains the information of interest.</p>

<p>The JDBC Database Realm supports the following additional attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>connectionName</td>
    <td>The database username to use when establishing the JDBC connection.
        This attribute is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>connectionPassword</td>
    <td>The database password to use when establishing the JDBC connection.
        This attribute is required.
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>connectionURL</td>
    <td>The connection URL to be passed to the JDBC driver.  This attribute
        is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>digest</td>
    <td>The name of the MessageDigest algorithm to be used to encode passwords
        in the database, or a zero-length string for no encoding.  If not
        specified, no encoding is the default.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>driverName</td>
    <td>The fully qualified Java class name of the JDBC driver to be used.
        This attribute is required.  (Note that the corresponding driver's
        JAR file needs to be placed in the $CATALINA_HOME/server directory
        in order to be accessible.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>roleNameCol</td>
    <td>The name of the column, in the "user roles" table, which contains
        the role name to be compared to.  This attribute is required.
    </td>    
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>userCredCol</td>
    <td>The name of the column, in the "users" table, which contains the
        user's credentials (i.e. password).  This attribute is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>userNameCol</td>
    <td>The name of the column, in the "users" and "user roles" tables,
        which contains the username of the user being looked up.  This
        attribute is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>userRoleTable</td>
    <td>The name of the table, in the associated database, containing the
        "user roles" information.  This attribute is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>userTable</td>
    <td>The name of the table, in the associated database, containing the
        "users" information.  This attribute is required.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>In order to be used by the JDBC Database Realm, your database must conform
to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be possible for Catalina to establish a JDBC connection to this
    database, using the configuration parameters described above.
<li>The database must contain a table containing "users" information, which
    must conform to the following rules:
    <ul>
    <li>There must be exactly one row for each valid user.</li>
    <li>There must be a column, named by the <code>userNameCol</code>
        attribute, that contains the username of the user represented
        by this row.</li>
    <li>There must be a column, named by the <code>userCredCol</code>
        attribute, that contains the credentials (password) of the user
        represented by this row.</li>
    <li>The credentials must be encoded by the MessageDigest algorithm
        configured by the <code>digest</code> attribute.
    <li>There must be at most one row for any specific username value.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The database must contain a table containing "user roles" information,
    which must conform to the following rules:
    <ul>
    <li>There must be exactly one row for each valid role that is assigned
        to a particular valid user.</li>
    <li>There may be more than one row for each valid user, one for each
        role assigned to that user.</li>
    <li>A valid user may have zero rows in this table, if that user is not
        assigned to any roles.</li>
    <li>There must be a column, named by the <code>userNameCol</code>
        attribute, that contains the username of the user whose role
        assignment is represented by this row.</li>
    <li>There must be a column, named by the <code>userRoleCol</code>
        attribute, that contains the role name assigned to this user.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Once a user is successfully authenticated, the following methods of the
<code>HttpServletRequest</code> interface will return useful values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>getRemoteUser()</strong> - Will return the username of the user
    who was authenticated.</li>
<li><strong>getUserPrincipal()</strong> - Will return a synthesized
    <code>java.security.Principal</code> implementation object representing
    the user who was authenticated.</li>
<li><strong>isUserInRole(String)</strong> - Will return <code>true</code> if
    the currently authenticated user has a valid assignment to the
    specified role.</li>
</ul>

<br>


<a name="MemoryRealm"></a>
<h3>Memory Based Realm (<code>org.apache.catalina.realm.MemoryRealm</code>)</h3>

<p>The <strong>Memory Based Realm</strong> initializes a simple memory-based
database from an XML configuration file (by default,
<code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code>) when Tomcat is first
initialized.  The format of this file is consistent with the format of the
corresponding file used in Tomcat 3.x versions.  An instance of a Memory
Based Realm is used in the example application that is shipped with Catalina.
</p>

<p>The Memory Based Realm supports the following additional attributes:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tr>
    <th width="15%">Attribute</th>
    <th width="85%">Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>pathname</code></td>
    <td>Relative or absolute pathname of the configuration file used to
        initialize the contents of this Realm.  If a relative path is
        specified, it is interpreted as relative to $CATALINA_HOME.  If
        no pathname is specified the default value is "conf/tomcat-users.xml"
        (relative to the Catalina home directory).
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>The configuration file specified by the <code>pathname</code> attribute must
be in XML format.  It consists of an outer element named
<code>&lt;tomcat-users&gt;</code>, along with one nested
<code>&lt;user&gt;</code> element for each defined user.  Each user element
supports the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> - The username of this user (must be unique among
    all users defined in this configuration file)</li>
<li><strong>password</strong> - The corresponding login password, in clear
    text</li>
<li><strong>roles</strong> - A comma-delimited list of the roles to which
    this user belongs, or a zero-length string for no role assignments</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a user is successfully authenticated, the following methods of the
<code>HttpServletRequest</code> interface will return useful values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>getRemoteUser()</strong> - Will return the username of the user
    who was authenticated.</li>
<li><strong>getUserPrincipal()</strong> - Will return a synthesized
    <code>java.security.Principal</code> implementation object representing
    the user who was authenticated.</li>
<li><strong>isUserInRole(String)</strong> - Will return <code>true</code> if
    the currently authenticated user has a valid assignment to the
    specified role.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Features</h2>

<h3>Single Sign On Support</h3>

<p>Normally, an individual user will need to authenticate himself or herself
to each web application individually, even if the underlying Realm is being
shared across an entire virtual host.  Often, it is desirable for the user
to be required to authenticate only once, and have that identity recognized
across all of the web applications for this host.</p>

<p>Tomcat includes <em>Single Sign On</em> support to enable this.  The
detailed configuration requirements can be found
<a href="../singlesignon.html" target="_new">here</a>.
