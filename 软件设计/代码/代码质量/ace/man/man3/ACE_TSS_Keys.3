.SH NAME
ACE_TSS_Keys \- Collection of in-use flags for a thread's TSS keys. For internal use only by ACE_TSS_Cleanup; it is public because some compilers can't use nested classes for template instantiation parameters.

.SH DETAILED DESCRIPTION
.PP 
Collection of in-use flags for a thread's TSS keys. For internal use only by ACE_TSS_Cleanup; it is public because some compilers can't use nested classes for template instantiation parameters.
.PP
.PP
 Wrapper around array of whether each key is in use. A simple typedef doesn't work with Sun C++ 4.2.

.PP 
.SS ACE_TSS_Keys::ACE_TSS_Keys (void)
.PP
Default constructor, to initialize all bits to zero (unused).
.PP
.SH MEMBER FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
.PP 
.SS void ACE_TSS_Keys::find (const u_int key, u_int & word, u_int & bit)\fC [static, private]\fR
.PP
For a given key, find the word and bit number that represent it.
.PP
.SS int ACE_TSS_Keys::test_and_clear (const \fBACE_thread_key_t\fR key)
.PP
Mark the specified key as not being in use, if it was not already so cleared. Returns 1 if the had already been cleared, 0 if not.
.PP
.SS int ACE_TSS_Keys::test_and_set (const \fBACE_thread_key_t\fR key)
.PP
Mark the specified key as being in use, if it was not already so marked. Returns 1 if the had already been marked, 0 if not.
.PP
.SH MEMBER DATA DOCUMENTATION
.PP 
.SS u_long ACE_TSS_Keys::key_bit_words_[ACE_WORDS]\fC [private]\fR
.PP
Bit flag collection. A bit value of 1 indicates that the key is in use by this thread.
