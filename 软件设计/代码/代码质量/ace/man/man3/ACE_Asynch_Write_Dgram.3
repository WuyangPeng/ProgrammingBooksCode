.SH DETAILED DESCRIPTION
.PP 
This class is a factory for starting off asynchronous writes on a UDP socket. This class forwards all methods to its implementation class.
.PP
.PP
 Once <open> is called, multiple asynchronous <writes>s can started using this class. An \fBACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram::Result\fR will be passed back to the <handler> when the asynchronous write completes through the  callback.

.PP 
.SS ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram::ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram (void)
.PP
A do nothing constructor.

Destructor.
.PP
.SH MEMBER FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
.PP 
.SS void ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram::implementation (\fBACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram_Impl\fR * implementation)\fC [protected]\fR
.PP
Set the implementation class.
.PP
.SS \fBACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram_Impl\fR * ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram::implementation (void) const
.PP
Return the underlying implementation class.
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS int ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram::open (\fBACE_Handler\fR & handler, ACE_HANDLE handle = ACE_INVALID_HANDLE, const void * completion_key = 0, \fBACE_Proactor\fR * proactor = 0)
.PP
Initializes the factory with information which will be used with each asynchronous call. If (<handle> == ACE_INVALID_HANDLE),  will be called on the <handler> to get the correct handle. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS \fBssize_t\fR ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram::send (\fBACE_Message_Block\fR * message_block, size_t & number_of_bytes_sent, int flags, const \fBACE_Addr\fR & remote_addr, const void * act = 0, int priority = 0, int signal_number = ACE_SIGRTMIN)
.PP
This starts off an asynchronous send. Upto <message_block->total_length()> will be sent. <message_block>'s  <rd_ptr> will be updated to reflect the sent bytes if the send operation is successfully completed. Return code of 1 means immediate success and <number_of_bytes_sent> is updated to number of bytes sent. The  method will still be called. Return code of 0 means the IO will complete proactively. Return code of -1 means there was an error, use errno to get the error code.
.PP
Scatter/gather is supported on WIN32 by using the <message_block->cont()> method. Up to ACE_IOV_MAX <message_block>'s are supported. Upto  <message_block->length()> bytes will be sent from each <message block> for a total of <message_block->total_length()> bytes. All <message_block>'s <rd_ptr>'s will be updated to reflect the bytes sent from each <message_block>.
.PP
Priority of the operation is specified by <priority>. On POSIX4-Unix, this is supported. Works like <nice> in Unix. Negative values are not allowed. 0 means priority of the operation same as the process priority. 1 means priority of the operation is one less than process. And so forth. On Win32, this argument is a no-op. <signal_number> is the POSIX4 real-time signal number to be used for the operation. <signal_number> ranges from ACE_SIGRTMIN to ACE_SIGRTMAX. This argument is a no-op on non-POSIX4 systems.
