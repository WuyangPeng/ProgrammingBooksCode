.SH DETAILED DESCRIPTION
.PP 
This class is a factory for starting off asynchronous reads on a UDP socket.
.PP
.PP
 Once <open> is called, multiple asynchronous <read>s can be started using this class. An \fBACE_Asynch_Read_Dgram::Result\fR will be passed back to the <handler> when the asynchronous reads completes through the  callback.

.SS ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Read_Dgram::ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Read_Dgram (\fBACE_WIN32_Proactor\fR * win32_proactor)
.PP
Constructor.

.PP
Do-nothing constructor.
.PP
.SH MEMBER FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
.PP 
.SS int ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Read_Dgram::cancel (void)
.PP
This cancels all pending accepts operations that were issued by the calling thread. The function does not cancel asynchronous operations issued by other threads. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_WIN32_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS int ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Read_Dgram::open (\fBACE_Handler\fR & handler, ACE_HANDLE handle, const void * completion_key, \fBACE_Proactor\fR * proactor)
.PP
Initializes the factory with information which will be used with each asynchronous call. If (<handle> == ACE_INVALID_HANDLE),  will be called on the <handler> to get the correct handle. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_WIN32_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS \fBACE_Proactor\fR * ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Read_Dgram::proactor (void) const
.PP
Return the underlying proactor.
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_WIN32_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS \fBssize_t\fR ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Read_Dgram::recv (\fBACE_Message_Block\fR * message_block, size_t & number_of_bytes_recvd, int flags, int protocol_family, const void * act, int priority, int signal_number)\fC [virtual]\fR
.PP
This starts off an asynchronous read. Upto <message_block->total_size()> will be read and stored in the <message_block>. <message_block>'s <wr_ptr> will be updated to reflect the added bytes if the read operation is successfully completed. Return code of 1 means immediate success and <number_of_bytes_recvd> will contain number of bytes read. The  method will still be called. Return code of 0 means the IO will complete proactively. Return code of -1 means there was an error, use errno to get the error code.
.PP
Scatter/gather is supported on WIN32 by using the <message_block->cont()> method. Up to ACE_IOV_MAX <message_block>'s are supported. Upto <message_block->size()> bytes will be read into each <message block> for a total of <message_block->total_size()> bytes. All <message_block>'s <wr_ptr>'s will be updated to reflect the added bytes for each <message_block>
