.SH DETAILED DESCRIPTION
.PP 
This class is a factory for starting off asynchronous reads on a UDP socket.
.PP
.PP
 Once <open> is called, multiple asynchronous <read>s can be started using this class. An \fBACE_Asynch_Read_Dgram::Result\fR will be passed back to the <handler> when the asynchronous reads completes through the  callback.

.SH MEMBER FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
.PP 
.SS int ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Asynch_Read_Dgram::cancel (void)
.PP
This cancels all pending accepts operations that were issued by the calling thread. The function does not cancel asynchronous operations issued by other threads. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_POSIX_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS int ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Asynch_Read_Dgram::open (\fBACE_Handler\fR & handler, ACE_HANDLE handle, const void * completion_key, \fBACE_Proactor\fR * proactor)
.PP
Initializes the factory with information which will be used with each asynchronous call. If (<handle> == ACE_INVALID_HANDLE),  will be called on the <handler> to get the correct handle. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_POSIX_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS \fBACE_Proactor\fR * ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Asynch_Read_Dgram::proactor (void) const
.PP
Return the underlying proactor.
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBACE_POSIX_Asynch_Operation\fR.
.SS \fBssize_t\fR ACE_POSIX_AIOCB_Asynch_Read_Dgram::recv (\fBACE_Message_Block\fR * message_block, size_t & number_of_bytes_recvd, int flags, int protocol_family, const void * act, int priority, int signal_number)\fC [virtual]\fR
.PP
This starts off an asynchronous read. Upto <message_block->total_size()> will be read and stored in the <message_block>. <message_block>'s <wr_ptr> will be updated to reflect the added bytes if the read operation is successful completed. Return code of 1 means immediate success and number_of_bytes_recvd will contain number of bytes read. The  method will still be called. Return code of 0 means the IO will complete proactively. Return code of -1 means there was an error, use errno to get the error code.
.PP
Priority of the operation is specified by <priority>. On POSIX4-Unix, this is supported. Works like <nice> in Unix. Negative values are not allowed. 0 means priority of the operation same as the process priority. 1 means priority of the operation is one less than process. <signal_number> argument is a no-op on non-POSIX4 systems.
