  // = DESCRIPTION
  //    This test demostrates the smart proxy feature in TAO 
  //    Note that though the interface has two methods just one
  //    of them can be "smartified" if necessary, the other one 
  //    simply performs the same way as would the default proxy.

      string reason;

  short method (in short boo) raises (Oops);
