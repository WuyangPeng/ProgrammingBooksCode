The following applications are used to measure performance of TAO's POA. 

        . Object_Creation_And_Registration

                This test is used to measure the time it takes to
                register and activate an object in the POA.

        . Demux

                This test directory tests various demultiplexing
                strategies used in the object adapter: searching for
                POAs, servants and operation names


        . Implicit_Activation

                Measure the time required to activate servants via _this()
