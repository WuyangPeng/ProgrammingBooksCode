    <s1 title="A new Cocoon sitemap implementation">
      <p>This page describes a new implementation of Cocoon's sitemap
      which dramatically increases Cocoon's start-up speed and the
      turnaround development time when writing applications using
      Cocoon.</p>

      <p>The new sitemap implementation reads the sitemap at runtime
      and translates its XML format into a program written in the
      algorithmic language <link
      href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</link>. Each time you
      make a new request to Cocoon, the Scheme program representation
      of the sitemap will be executed.</p>

      <p>More to come...</p>
