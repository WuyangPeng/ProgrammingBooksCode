 <release version="2.0.1" date="January 31 2002">
  <action dev="SW" type="update" due-to="Stephan Michels" due-to-email="stephan@vern.chem.tu-berlin.de">
    The FragmentExtractorTransformer is now configurable to extract any fragment
    identified by an element name and namespace URI, and no more limited to
    SVG images only.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="fix">
    XSP engine now correctly works with dynamically generated sources
    with last modification date of 0, and it is correctly reloaded on Cocoon
    reload.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Logicsheets are resolved using instance of url factory source resolver 
    (URLFactorySourceResolver), and not the current request resolver (which
    is temporary object).
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Improve Lucene indexing. Only one Lucene document is created for one 
    Cocoon resource. Document consists from 'body' field with all the text,
    'element' field for every &lt;element&gt;, and 'element@attribute' for 
    every attribute of the &lt;element&gt;.
  </action>
  <action dev="GF" type="fix">
   Fixed performance issues in the Store implementation:
   (1) removed the FilesystemQueueImpl, one thread less now, (2) changed swapping 
   alghorithm in the MRUMemoryStore towards less serialization, (3) Cache entries
   will be saved to the filesystem, when the System is shutdown cleanly, (4) fixed
   bug submitted by Peter Hargreaves [pdh@totalise.co.uk] in StoreJanitor
   (GC hangs in endless loop).
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Serializers do not write namespace attributes for prefixes starting with
    xml anymore (these are reserved by XML spec).
  </action>
  <action dev="GF" type="update">
   Removed Event Cache and Stream Cache. For all possible Caching Piplines there
   is only one Store implementation behind.
  </action>
  <action dev="GF" type="update">
   Added new log targets. (1) access.log, (2) core.log, (3) error.log and
   (4) sitemap.log.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Perform substitution in the sitemap only when it is required (improves
    performace).
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="add">
    Additions to sitemap syntax: (1) allow all elements at root level, not 
    only matchers, (2) perform some validation checks, (3) perform attribute
    substitution on all attributes except @type and @label.
  </action>
  <action dev="DC" type="add">
    Added &quot;List of Docs&quot; which automatically generates a list
    of all Cocoon documentation by aggregating each xdocs/**/book.xml
  </action>
  <action dev="DC" type="fix" fixes-bug="5060">
    The Catalog Entity Resolver is now fully operational on all platforms
    in both the webapp context and the commandline context of build docs.
    The verbosity level is now set low - if you want to see messages, then
    raise the verbosity via cocoon.xconf or CatalogManager.properties
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Separated the jars into core and optional. For compiling only the
    core jars are necessary. However, the sample webapp still needs some
    optional jars.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="add">
    Added matchers: 
    RegexpHeaderMatcher, RegexpRequestAttributeMatcher,
    RegexpRequestParameterMatcher, RegexpSessionAttributeMatcher,
    RequestAttributeMatcher, SessionAttributeMatcher,
    WildcardHostMatcher, WildcardRequestAttributeMatcher.
  </action>
  <action dev="BL" type="fix" fixes-bug="5791">
    Address issue about how RegexpURIMatcher matches the "" pattern.
    Because it is so different from WildcardURIMatcher, the "" pattern
    is rewritten as "^$" which matches an empty string.  The event is
    logged, along with the hint that if you really want to match
    everything, the pattern ".*" works as advertised.
  </action>
  <action dev="BL" type="update">
    Fix command line generation so that a broken link was not a fatal
    error, and processing will continue after the link is reported as
    bad.
  </action>
  <action dev="BL" type="add">
    Add ability to serialize all broken links to a file when running in
    command line mode.  This helps debug sites.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Rename some of the matchers/serializers (new added, old deprecated):
    RequestSelector to RequestParameterSelector,
    RequestParamMatcher to RequestParameterMatcher,
    WildcardParameterValueMatcher to WildcardRequestParameterMatcher,
    RegexpTargetHostMatcher to RegexpHostMatcher.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Wap serializer renamed to wml serializer in the sitemap shipped with
    Cocoon, to be consistent with the names of other serializers.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    FilterTransformer is now Cacheable.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Added CACHE_VALIDITY singleton object to NOPCacheValidity and changed all
    components to use constant instead of creating new instances each time.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="fix">
    Fix lifecycle related bugs in i18n transformer. Now transformers handles
    only lifecycle of resource bundle factory, which handles lifecycle of all
    resource bundles.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="add">
    Added special lifecycle interface for Cocoon components: RequestLifecycle.   
    A component marked by this interface has the lifecycle of one request,
    so looking up the role twice during the same request results in the same
    component.
  </action>
  <action dev="SW" type="update">
    The "namespace-prefixes" feature is no more set on parsers. It can be set if
    needed in the configuration.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="add">
    Added ability to use XPath expressions to query XML:DB collections using
    XML:DB pseudo protocol. URL should be in form:
    xmldb:dbxml://host:port/db/collection/#/xpath
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="add">
    Enabled XML:DB support (generators and pseudo protocol) by default.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="fix" fixes-bug="4239">
    JSPEngine returns result in UTF-8 charset.
  </action>
  <action dev="CH" type="add">
    Changed invokation syntax of sitemap resources. Now &lt;call resource/&gt;
    is used instead of &lt;redirect-to resource/&gt;. Affects only resources,
    other redirections still use "old" syntax. New syntax does not take "target"
    attribute but allows to set arbitrary parameters by using
    &lt;map-parameter/&gt; Always creates new map while old syntax only did
    when "target" was present. Old syntax still available but deprecated.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="fix" due-to="Eisert, Wolfram" due-to-email="Wolfram.Eisert@Dresdner-Bank.com">
    XSP page were called twice if used as a source of XSLT stylesheet due to multiple calls to 
    Source.getInputSource() in XSLProcessorImpl.
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="update">
    Changed default upload directory from "image-dir" to "upload-dir".
  </action>
  <action dev="VG" type="add" due-to="MIYABE Tatsuhiko" due-to-email="miyabe@jzf.co.jp">
    RequestGenerator accepts container-encoding and form-encoding parameters.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Added support for configurable URLFactories.
  </action>
  <action dev="SW" type="fix">
    Made the cache work again by updating cocoon.roles, sitemap.roles and making EventPipeline
    and StreamPipeline implement Recomposable instead of just Composable.
  </action>
  <action dev="GR" type="add">
    Added the XML:DB pseudo protocol
  </action>
  <action dev="SW" type="add">
    Status generator outputs a detailed description of what's in the cache. Patch submitted by
    Sebastien Koechlin [skoechlin@ivision.fr]
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Applied patch adding advanced error handling to SQLTransformer plus escape-string element
    from Peter Seiderer [Peter.Seiderer@ciselant.de]
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    The JaxpParser is now poolable and configurable.
  </action>
  <action dev="SW" type="update">
    The sitemap engine is now a regular component available through Processor.ROLE. This allows
    alternative implementations of Processors (e.g. interpreted sitemap, flowmap, statemap) to
    be plugged through cocoon.xconf. Note : to ensure compatibility with existing cocoon.xconf
    files, the shorthand for the Processor role is "sitemap".
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Added support for configurable SourceFactories.
    Patch submitted by Gianugo Rabellino [gianugo@rabellino.it].
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="add">

   that allow actions to be written in XSP and parts of the generated XML
   to be captured in XMLFragment or DOM objects.
  </action>
 </release>
 <release version="2.0" date="November 29, 2001">
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Restructured build system. A new ant task (SitemapToolTask) adds entries
    of optional components to the sitemap. Warnings for not available
    optional components are printed out.
  </action>
  <action dev="GP" type="update">
    Made the concept of views work as proposed in the original proposal. There
    is now the possibility to attach a label attribute with multiple values separated
    by blanks or commas to the following elements: map:generator, map:transformer,
    map:generate, map:transform, map:aggregate and map:part.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    Applied patch for session-info for TraxTransformer from J&ouml;rn Heid
    [heid@fh-heilbronn.de].

 </release>
 <release version="2.0rc2" date="November 7, 2001">
  <action dev="SW" type="add">
    Deprecation of CodeFactory in preparation of the tree traversal implementation of the sitemap.
    All factory-based matchers have been rewritten using the new PreparableMatcher interface, and
    all factory-based selectors have been rewritten as regular implementations of Selector.
    For patterns whose syntax uses '{' like regexp, sitemap substitution can be avoided by escaping the
    brace character (example : "pat\{2}ern" will match "pattern").
  </action>
  <action dev="SW" type="fix">
    Reduce exception nesting in case of sitemap setup errors, and display all nested exceptions
    in the error page (avoids searching the logs for the failure cause).

  <action dev="SW" type="update">
    Added attribute management methods to environment Context and its implementations.
  </action>
  <action dev="SW" type="update">
    Updated TraxTransformer and XSLTProcessor to allow simultaneous use of several

    directory generator.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="fix">
   Throw exception for internal requests instead of using the error handler and
   fixed component handling in subsitemaps when invoked internally. Components only
   defined in a subsitemap were not found as for internal requests the parent
   component manager was used.
  </action>
  <action dev="CZ" type="update">
    When Cocoon is reloaded, the logkit configuration is now also reloading. 
    This enables changing the logkit settings during runtime.
