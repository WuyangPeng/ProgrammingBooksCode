Here is the source code used in the preparation of "The Pragmatic
Programmer". You should be able to find everything except the short
examples where we cheated and just typed code inline.

The code is organized into directories according to the source
language: c, cc, eiffel, java, perl and sh. There's also a directory
called 'lang' containing code used the "Domain Languages" exercises.

This code has been run and tested under Linux (2.0.35 kernel, glibc) with:

  - gcc 2.7.2.3
  - egcs-2.90.27 980315 (egcs-1.0.2 release)
  - java 1.1.6
  - iContract 1.1.7
  - SmallEiffel -0.79

You'll also need GNU Make.

Please let us know if you come across problems with this code. You can 
reach us at ppbook@pragmaticprogrammer.com.

Thanks

Dave & Andy
