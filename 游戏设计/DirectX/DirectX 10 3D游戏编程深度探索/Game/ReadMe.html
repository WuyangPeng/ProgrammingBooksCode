<h1>Mobots Attack!</h1>
<p>This project ended up being considerably larger than I originally
anticipated.&nbsp; All told, with all the projects, it's almost 20,000 lines of
code.&nbsp; The purpose of this file is to give you the necessary info you'll
need to make this code useful to you.&nbsp; I want to take a moment to thank
Lydia Choy for doing the models and textures for this game.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>There are 6 projects in the workspace.&nbsp; They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>GameLib</i>.&nbsp; We've seen this before; it's all of our DirectX code
    and some game-related code.&nbsp; It is essentially unchanged from
    chapter 8.</li>
  <li><i>Math3d</i>.&nbsp; Also something that should be familiar.&nbsp; This
    library hasn't changed much since chapter 3.</li>
  <li><i>NetLib</i>.&nbsp; Dan's multi-threaded networking library from chapter
    5.</li>
  <li><i>GameCommon</i>.&nbsp; This is a lib that holds most of the similar code
    between the client and the server.&nbsp; This project essentially exists to
    expedite compile times.</li>
  <li>GameClient.&nbsp; This is a GameLib style application like most of the
    other book samples.&nbsp; It connects to a server (either running on the
    same machine or somewhere else on the internet) and allows a user to run
    around inside the world and fire rockets. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>Make sure you have STLport set up before you try playing with this.&nbsp; The
stress that the Visual C++ list STL class was putting on the heap was causing
all sorts of hairy problems (leaks, crashes, etc).&nbsp; The STLport list class
ends up barely allocating at all since it does things The Right Way.&nbsp; If
you are getting access violations out of the box, most likely this is because
the code is using the Visual C++ version of the STL.&nbsp; To setup STLport,
unzip the files (they're in the 'other code' directory) to a local drive, then
set up the directory with all the headers in Visual C in the tools-&gt;options
dialog; making sure that it appears in the list above the Visual C STL
files.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>To aid in the finding of bugs and the reporting of info while the game is
running, there are two helpful functions that work on both the client and the
server.&nbsp; They are DebPrint() and LogPrint().&nbsp; They both take a list of
arguments a'la printf.. an example: LogPrint(&quot;some number %d&quot;,
some_number);&nbsp; DebPrint prints the line to the screen.&nbsp; On the server,
the text shows up in the edit box, on the client it becomes the bottom of the
list of strings making the psuedo-console.&nbsp; LogPrint writes the line to a
file.&nbsp; For the client, the file is &quot;clientLog.txt&quot; and for the
server it's &quot;serverLog.txt&quot;.&nbsp; I detest the iostream library,
sorry.</p>
<h3>Grokking</h3>
<p>If you want to dig into the code and figure out how it works, a good place to
start would be MsgDaemon.* (in the GameCommon project).&nbsp; That details the
way objects are classified and how they communicate with each other.&nbsp; From
there you should explore the Net Messages (starting with NetMessages.*).&nbsp;
This code builds on the object communication system to allow for communications
to be sent over the wire to other machines.&nbsp; Read each of the entity files
(note that cGameEntPara isn't used in this version of the code, but was left for
the sake of helping people out).&nbsp; Find In Files is your friend.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>The server doesn't have any command-line options.&nbsp; The client has a
plethora of them.&nbsp; Besides the standard ones (the -res#x#. -forceSW/HW, -iter/nameDDraw),
there are the following options.</p>
<ul>
  <li>-client aa.bb.cc.dd<br>
    This instructs the client to attempt to connect to a server living on the
    machine with IP aa.bb.cc.dd.&nbsp; If this option isn't included, it is
    assumed that the client should connect to localhost (127.0.0.1)</li>
  <li>-name your_name<br>
    Makes the players name &quot;your_name&quot;.&nbsp; The name can't have any
    spaces, and must be less than 32 characters.</li>
  <li>-noTex<br>
    Runs the game without textures.&nbsp; This is for people playing on slower
    machines, or people whose cards do not support 32 bit ARGB textures.</li>
  <li>-iMouse<br>
    Some people like their mice inverted.&nbsp; Others didn't get hugged enough
    when they were young.&nbsp; Okay, I was kidding about that last part, but if
    you don't want your mouse to be inverted specify this flag.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>The following table lists out the keys and what they do.&nbsp; One of the
first things you'll probably want to do is re-map them... but this is similar to
what my quake setup is.</p>
<table border="1" width="45%">

<h3>ToDo</h3>
<p>If you want to add stuff to the game, you have your work cut out for you; the
project is just a bare minimum set up.&nbsp; Adding features is the fun
part.&nbsp; Some ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no prediction (interpolation or extrapolation). That, combined
    with the latency, is why the game is so choppy.&nbsp; This is a big thing to
    fix.</li>
  <li>The text printing system in the game client is far from ideal.&nbsp; Using
    GDI is an all-around bad idea; quads with textured letters should be used
    instead.</li>
  <li>The players can currently glide right through each other.&nbsp; That's
    bad. :)</li>
  <li>There is little or no physics in the game right now.&nbsp; This was mostly
    because the planned physics chapter had to be pulled a few months ago. </li>
  <li>There should be some sort of frag limit or time limit.</li>
  <li>Adding bots using the code written in chapter 4 wouldn't be difficult at
    all.</li>
  <li>The projectile objects should explode when they hit things, instead of
    just dissapearing.&nbsp; One way to do this would be to have the rocket
    object spawn an explosion object on the server when it explodes, and have
    the creation be broadcast over the network.&nbsp; Giving the explosion
    visual flair on the client side wouldn't be too difficult, and as an added
    bonus you could add splash damage on the server side for when the projectile
    hits the ground near your target</li>
  <li>There's only one weapon.&nbsp; And only one model.&nbsp; And only one
    level.</li>
  <li>The robots should have some sort of HUD giving them a health amount.&nbsp;
    Adding health and ammo boxes would be cool.</li>
  <li>There should be some mechanism for people to type in messages that get
    broadcast to the other players&nbsp; </li>
  <li>If the server doesn't hear from a client for a little bit, the client is
    probably not playing anymore, but was unable to send a logout request.&nbsp;
    However the server still things the client is connected, still sends
    messages, and doesn't allow a client from that IP to reconnect.&nbsp; This
    could be fixed by, for example, writing a function called TimeoutHosts() that returns
    a list hosts that have not sent any data in the last however many milliseconds.&nbsp;
    However, clients will need to send an 'i'm still here' packet to avoid
    false-positives (if the player doesn't move, currently no messages get sent
    back and forth). </li>
  <li>Right now a whole lot of relatively small net messages are being sent, and
    they're not being compressed.&nbsp; Implement some scheme to prevent bandwidth
    overflow </li>
</ul>
