Model description       : The Droideka(or Destroyer Droid) from STARWARS Episode 1 by LucasFilms.  Personally, I thought they were much neater than the normal droids so I decided to make a quake model of them

Other info              : Here is the Official story form some page in a starwars book my cousin Richard e-mailed me:

"To Make up for the weaknesses of battle droids, a special contract was awarded for the creation of an altogether different combat droid that would be a much more serious weapon.  The design was created by a species of chitinous Colicoids in their own image on a planet far from the Republic's Core.  Colicoids are known for their completely unfeeling and murderous ways, and Collo IV has been embroiled for many years in diplomatic disputes related to the death and consumption of visitors to the system.  The droideka was exactly what concerned Trade Federation officers wanted: a formidalbe, heavy-duty killing machine to back up the battle droids in the face of determined opposition."

It got stuck in the quake universe the same way that all the other Star Wars Guys did, (black hole or something) but its sheilds are not functional. (there are way too many verts already)
This is my first quake model, at least that i've finished, and I think I did a pretty good job on it.  I have some artistic talent and have done some artwork on the computer before, and I think it turned out pretty well.  Some people might not like the rolling thing, but I like it because even though it is not my original idea, it is very different from other quake ppms while still fitting in.  It is not a clan model so you can use it no matter if any idiot tries to tell you not to.  If someone wants to make a Starwars mod I would not be in opposition of them using my model in it, just put my name in the credits somewhere and email me and tell me about it so I can download it.  I don't plan on making another model but might consider it if you wanted to pay me (and I'm not expirienced enough to have anyone in their right mind to hire me, so this is most likely my last)

* How to use this model *

Unzip the contents of droideka.zip into quake2/baseq2/players
this is a really dumb place to put this since you can't read this until after you've done it but oh well. Anyway because of this I'm only including 1 folder in the zip
