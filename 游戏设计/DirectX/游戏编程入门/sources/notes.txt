Beginning Game Programming, Third Edition
Jonathan Harbour


Dear Reader,

If you have any problems compiling the source code from this book, it's almost always a simple matter of configuring Visual C++ or DirectX, rather than legitimate bugs in the code or errors in the book (although these do happen from time to time). If any errors are found, fixes will be available online.

I encourage you to visit the forum at www.jharbour.com/forum for help if you run into any problems. A quick search through the forum will likely provide an answer to any question or technical difficulty. Visual C++ is an extremely complicated software product, as is the DirectX SDK--combined, they are even more difficult to figure out. But there are answers if you run into problems. 

I look forward to hearing from you.
