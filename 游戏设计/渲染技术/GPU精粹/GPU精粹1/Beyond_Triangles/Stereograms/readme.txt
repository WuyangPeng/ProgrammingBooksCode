=========================

This Cg Shader Demo is an example of how to generate stereograms (like in MagicEye from www.magiceye.com). From a given depth map image (grayscale) and a tile image (color generic image) the stereogram is generated. 

Looking at the stereogram the right way, it is possible to see the hidden 3D image that represents the given depth map. It is possible to combine different depth maps with different tile images for different-looking stereograms. Use the file menu to load different depth maps and tile images.

The following keys can be used in the demo:

Ctrl+O for opening a new depth map
Ctrl+T for opening a new tile image
Ctrl+I for inverting the depth
'<','>' keys to change the depth factor
'-','+' keys to change the stripe size

For the animated stereogram (very difficult to see... only for advanced stereogram viewers), check the view menu option 'Depth from 3D Mesh' and select depth factor setting 'Super (2.0)'. Look at the stereogram and when you have your vision fixed on the 3d scene (table with teapot and sphere) click the key '2' for selecting an animated camera. You can switch from static and animated camera by clicking '1' and '2' respectively.

Enjoy,
