* How to use this model *
<INSTALLATION INFO>
Unzip md3-thetick.pk3 into your baseq3 subfolder in the Quake3 Directory.  If you have any problems, just make sure that the "md3-thetick.pk3" and the "bot-thetick.pk3" are in the baseq3 folder in your Quake3 Directory. In order to use this model as a player model, it may be necessary to create a baseq3/models/players/thetick folder under the Quake3 directory, and place any file in it. The model can also be used by entering "model thetick" in the console.  To use the bot, you can enter "addbot thetick" in the console.  If you get an error telling you that thetick bot is not defined it is because you have another bot.pk3 from another model that was loaded after thetick bot.  To fix this, just rename "bot-thetick.pk3" to "zbot-thetick.pk3" which will cause it to load last and use the "bot.txt" which will make the bot work properly.
