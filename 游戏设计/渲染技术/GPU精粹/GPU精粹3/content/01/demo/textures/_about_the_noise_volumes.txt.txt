The volumes are stored in a RAW format with a 5-integer header.
They are 16x16x16 texels in size, and each texel contains four random 
half-precision floats in the range [0..1].  The file also stores
all mip levels down to 1x1x1.  Noise*.vol are just four different 
volumes with different random values in them; PackedNoise*.vol are 
special.  In the red channel they have all the same info as the Noise*.vol
textures.  However, the green/blue/alpha channels store information about
the values in the red channel for the neighboring texels in +Y, +Z, and +YZ,
respectively.  This allows you to fetch a value, with incredibly high 
interpolation precision, by doing manual trilinear interpolation, but you
only have to take TWO texture samples instead of eight.  See 
the NHQu() function in shaders\sampleNoise.h for an example of how to
do this.
