DynamicAO is a sample program that shows ambient occlusion data being calculated on the fly for each frame of animation. It should automatically load the data and start running. If it does not then select file/open... to select the bigguy.ani file. Alternatively, it can load a single mesh from a wavefront.obj format file. The mesh must be all quads and tris (preferable quads) and must contain texture coordinates since they are used to guide the building of the surface element hierarchy used in the algorithm.

Viewpoint

the viewpoint can be changed using the mouse. Draging with the left button pressed rotates the view. The right button is for dolly and the middle button is for pan. The left and right button can be pressed at the same time for pan also.
