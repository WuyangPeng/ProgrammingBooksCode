This is the sample code which illustrates the GPU Gems II chapter, "Mipmap-Level Measurement".  
It requires DirectX 9 and Visual Studio 7.1.

Compile and run the program.  You should see a test object, shaped approximately like a 
piece of sloping terrain.  Use the keyboard to move the eyepoint and/or the object.  You
can see how the program correctly determines which is the highest visible mipmap level.
