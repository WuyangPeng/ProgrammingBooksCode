      <br><br>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>This source code implements the concepts discussed in Chapter
      21 of <i>GPU Gems II</i>.  The code is a slightly modified
      version of the actual source code used in <b>NVIDIA Gelato</b>,
      a film-quality renderer.  More information on Gelato can be
      found at the <a href="http://film.nvidia.com">NVIDIA Film Group</a>
      website.</p>

      <p>The concepts are implemented in a command-line (console)
      program which can render Gelato <i>grid dump</i> files, a number
      of which are included as examples.  The code works under both
      Windows XP and Linux.  The program can render directly to an
      onscreen window, or to a PPM file.  Each image is rendered as an
      array of tiles with an arbitrary super-sample resolution which
      are downsampled to the final resolution using an arbitrarily
      large filter kernel.  The code is structured such that it should
      be relatively easy to replace the gridfile rendering with your
      own rendering code.</p>

      <p>To compile the code under Windows XP using Visual Studio .NET:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the solution file <code>hqaa/hqaa.vcproj</code></li>
          <li>Build and run the example with <code>Debug -> Start</code>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The code will be compiled and the killeroo example scene
      (courtesy Headus) will be rendered to an onscreen window.  You
      can also compile the Debug solution if you want to enable a host
      of debugging code in the Gpu library.  This slows down rendering
      significantly.  Note that the debug mode automatically defines
      the pre-processing directive <code>DEBUG</code> which is used
      within the code to enable extra checks and assertions (see
      <code>dassert.h</code>).</p>

      <p>To compile the code under Linux:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li><code>% cd top-level-directory</code></li>
          <li><code>% make</code></li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <p>To remove all build objects and executables, use <code>"make
      clean"</code>.  To compile the code with lots of slow debugging
      checks enabled, use "<code>make DEBUG=1</code>".</p>

      <p>The <code>scenes</code> directory contains a number of
      example scenes that can be rendered with the test program,
      including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>grids.pyg</i> simplified killeroo (courtesy Headus) model</li>
        <li><i>aatest.pyg</i> useful for testing standard aliasing
        issues</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Additional utilities are provided to help create new scenes
      using gelato, which is a <a
      href="http://film.nvidia.com/page/gelato_download.html">free
      download</a>.  To create new scenes, you can use Maya and
      gelato's <i>Mango</i> plugin to create PYG or RIB files which
      can then be converted to gridfiles for use in hqaa.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><i>rendergrids.pyg</i> is a gelato scene file that can be
	  used to render a grid dump file in gelato.
          Use by changing the Input() file and rendering
          with:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>%&nbsp;gelato&nbsp;onetile.pyg&nbsp;-iv</code></li><br>

          <li><i>griddump.pyg</i> is a gelato scene file that can be
          included to generate griddump pyg files for use in hqaa.
          Make sure to put griddump.pyg as the first scene file on the
          gelato command line.</li>

       </ul>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Top-level Control Loop</h3>

      <p>The code in <code>hqaa.cpp</code> contains command-line
      argument processing and the top-level control loop.  It relies
      on two application classes in <code>downsample.cpp</code> and
      <code>accumulate.cpp</code> which perform the 2D downsample and
      accumulation directly on the GPU.  All of these files rely on
      various utilities in the <a href=#utillib>utility library</a>
      and the <a href=#gpulib>gpu library</a> which is a high-level
      C++ wrapper around common OpenGL functions along with nice state
      management and debugging features.</p>

      <p>The top level control loop handles the argument processing
      using the utility library's ArgParse class.  You can set any of
      the input parameters and choose the name of the output file.
      Here is the usage message:</p>
      
<pre>
       scenefile          Input scene file
       -camera x y z      Camera location
       -lookat x y z      Camera direction
       -fov angle         Camera field of view
       -nearfar near far  Camera clipping planes
       -resolution x y    Image resolution in pixels
       -bucketsize x y    Bucket size in pixels
       -supersample x y   Super-sample resolution
       -filter name x y   Filter name and radii in pixels
       -bitdepth b        32, 16, or 8 bits per channel
       -o filename        Output image filename
</pre>

      <p>If you don't specify an output filename, the image is
      rendered directly to an onscreen window.</p>

      <p>Pseudo-code for the main loop:</p>
      <blockquote>
<pre>
construct camera matrices and initialize tile drawing surface
for each tile row:
  for each tile column:
    compute the offset matrix for this tile's view
    render the entire scene into super-sampled tile buffer
    downsample the super-sampled tile to final resolution
    accumulate the final-resolution tile into the output buffer
</pre>
        </blockquote>

      <p>Note that when setting up the camera to tile matrix, the
      flipy option is used to display images in onscreen windows
      flipped with respect to the compute order used when outputting
      scanlines to a file.</p>

      <p>The following variables are used below:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding=5 border=1>
            <tr>
              <td><code>tx, ty</code></td>
              <td>Tile Size in final image pixels</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>ssx, ssy</code></td>
              <td>Supersamples per final pixel</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>fx, fy</code></td>
              <td>Filter radius in final image pixels</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>

      <p>During computation, the application allocates the following
      rendering surfaces:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding=5 border=1>
            <tr>
              <td><code>tx*ssx, ty*ssy</code></td>
              <td>Tile rendering buffer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>tx+2*fx, ssy*(ty+2*fx)</code></td>
              <td>Downsample intermediate buffer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>resx, resy</code></td>
              <td>Accumulate (when rendering to window)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>resx, ty+2*fx</code></td>
              <td>Accumulate (when rendering to a file)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>

      <p>These limits must fall below the GPU-imposed limits, or
      buffer allocation will fail.  When outputting to a file, the
      image is computed one tile strip at a time to reduce memory
      requirements.  </p>

      <a name="downsample">&nbsp;</a>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Downsample and Accumulate</h3>

      <p>The <code>GpuDownsample</code> class handles the downsampling
      and filtering of the tile rendered at super-sample resolution
      returning a texture that contains a high-quality version of the
      final tile padded by the filter radius.  The work is performed
      using an intermediate pbuffer to render the two separable
      filtering passes.  The final result is left on the GPU in the
      form of a usable texture.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding=5 border=1>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuDownsample</code></td>
              <td>Constructor, no required arguments</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>~GpuDownsample</code></td>
              <td>Destructor, frees any allocated resources</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuDownsample::tile </code></td>
              <td>Downsamples a tile stored in the passed-in texture
              with the specified dimensions and filter and returns the
              result in a GpuTexture reference.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The <code>GpuAccumulate</code> class handles the accumulation
      of the final downsampled and filtered tiles into the final image
      buffer.  It can work in two different modes: whole image or tile
      strips.  The accumulate class is started either once for the
      entire image using <code>begin_image()</code> or once for each
      strip of tiles using <code>begin_strip()</code>.  Strips are
      assumed to be computed from the origin to the top of the
      image.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding=5 border=1>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuAccumulate</code></td>
              <td>Constructor, no required arguments</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>~GpuAccumulate</code></td>
              <td>Destructor, frees any allocated resources</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuAccumulate::begin_strip</code></td>
              <td>Call when computing the image in strips before
              beginning a new strip of tiles.  Note that it is assumed
              that strips are computed starting at the origin and
              moving up to the height of the image.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuAccumulate::begin_image</code></td>
              <td>Call when compute the image with a single
              accumulation buffer or rendering directly to a window.
              Since this allocates a larger buffer than when rendering
              in strips, this rendering mode may not work with large
              resolutions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuAccumulate::tile</code></td>
              <td>Pass in a downsampled, padded tile for accumulation</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>GpuAccumulate::end</code></td>
              <td>Call after rendering a tile strip or the entire
              image to retrieve the accumulated texture buffer. When
              rendering to a window, this will also enable a simple
              event loop to repaint the window and wait for the Escape
              key.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

      <a name="Extensions">&nbsp;</a>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Extensions</h3>

      <p>This code can be easily extended or optimized.  Here are a
      few ideas:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Arbitrarily wide images</i>.  Extend the
        <code>GpuAccumulate</code> class to handle non-zero x origins
        and use a list of GpuAccumulate objects to tile strips wider
        than the maximum pbuffer width.</li><br>

        <li><i>Transparency</i>.  Implement transparent surface
        support by adding either a sorting pass followed by
        back-to-front rendering, or by using depth peeling.</li><br>

        <li><i>Bucketed geometry</i>.  Instead of rendering the entire
        list of <code>GpuPrimitive</code> objects for each tile,
        restrict rendering to only those primitives whose bounding box
        intersects the active tile.</li><br>

        <li><i>Render to texture</i>.  Under Windows, the render-to-texture
	functions can be used to skip copying framebuffers
        into texture in both the <code>Downsample</code> and
        <code>Accumulate</code> classes.  See the code blocks in the
        <code>Gpu</code> library that are bracked by <code>#ifdef
        RTT</code> for some helpful routines.</li><br>

        <li><i>Multithreading</i>.  Render tiles in separate threads.
        Start by making the Gpu library threadsafe, and then extend
        the tiled rendering loop to render each tile in a separate
        thread.</li><br>

        <li><i>glDrawElements and Vertex Buffer Objects</i>.  Extend
        the Gpu library to render quadmeshes with a single
        glDrawElements call using the VBO extension for additional
        performance when re-rendering meshes for each tile.</li><br>

        <li><i>Skip empty buckets</i>.  There is no need to downsample
        empty buckets, or with a 1x1 box filter.</li><br>

        <li><i>Extend to non-NVIDIA GPUs</i>.  The current code only
        works on NV30-class hardware due to the use of NVIDIA-specific
        vertex and fragment program code and certain extensions
        including occlusion query and texture rectangles.  Switch this
        platform- dependent code over to OpenGL ARB
        extensions.</li><br>

      </ul>

      <a name="gpulib">&nbsp;</a>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Gpu Library</h3>

      <p>The Gpu library is a C++ wrapper around high-level OpenGL
      graphics functions.  It is designed to make it easy to create
      on- or off-screen buffers for doing computational work with the
      GPU.  It provides a stateful environment that is designed to
      facilitate debugging complex GPGPU applications.  It works under
      both Windows and Linux to provide a platform-independent GPU
      API.</p>

      <p>Texture objects make it easy to define and use textures from
      CPU-side data and directly from framebuffers.  Since
      render-to-texture is not supported under Linux currently, the
      Gpu library only supports copy-fb-to-texture.  All textures are
      treated as single-level, rectangular textures with no support
      for mip-mapping.</p>

      <p>For more details, please see the <code>gpu.h</code> header file.</p>

      <p>Simplest way to draw a 2D rectangle:</p>
<pre>
    GpuPBuffer pbuffer (256, 256);
    GpuCanvas canvas (pbuffer);
    GpuDrawmode drawmode ();
    GpuPrimitive rect (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);
    rect.render (drawmode, canvas);
</pre>
    
      <p>Create a 2x2 texture and bind it to texture unit 0:</p>
<pre>
    GpuTexture texture ("my texture");
    Vector3 color[4] = {{1,0,0}, {0,1,0}, {0,0,1}, {1,1,1}};
    texture.load (&color, 2, 2);
    drawmode.texture (0, &texture);
</pre>
    
      <p>Make the drawmode 3D drawing mode and create and draw a quadmesh:</p>
<pre>
    Matrix4 c2s = Matrix4::PerspectiveMatrix (45, 1, 0.01, 10000);
    drawmode.view (&c2s, 256, 256);
    Vector3 P[4] = {{0,0,0}, {1,0,0}, {1,1,0}, {0,1,0}};
    GpuQuadmesh quadmesh (2, 2, P)
    Vector3 texcoord[4] = {{1,0,0}, {0,1,0}, {0,0,1}, {1,1,1}};
    quadmesh.texcoord (0, texcoord);
    quadmesh.render (drawmode, canvas);
</pre>

      <p>Creating and using a fragment program with a constant parameter:</p>
<pre>
    const char *fp10 = "!!FP1.0\nMOVR o[COLR], p[0];\nEND\n";
    GpuFragmentProgram fp ("red", fp10);
    fp.parameter (0, Vector4(1,0,0,0));
    drawmode.fragment_program (&fp);
</pre>
    
      <p>An example of how to do an occlusion query with multiple draw
      statements:</p>
<pre>
    GpuOcclusionQuery oq ("depth peel");
    canvas.begin_occlusion_query (oq);
    quadmesh.render (drawmode, canvas);
    ...
    quadmesh.render (drawmode, canvas);
    canvas.end_occlusion_query (oq);
    ... < do something to hide latency > ...
    printf ("occlusion query had %d visible fragments\n", oq.count());
</pre>
  
      <p>An example of how copy-from-fb-to-texture works:</p>
<pre>
    GpuTexture fromfb ("rendered texture");
    fromfb.load (canvas, 0, 0, 256, 256);
    drawmode.texture (0, &fromfb);
</pre>
