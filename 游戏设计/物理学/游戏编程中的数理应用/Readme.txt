6. Getting Help

Known Issues:
The CD-ROM interface was made with Flash 5, on the PC side.  For the Mac, a
combination of Flash 5 and AppleScript was used.  Macromedia Flash defaults to
look for Internet Explorer instead of your default browser.  There is no work
around for this.  If you can click around inside the interface, but some buttons
seem to do nothing, this may be the issue.  To access the information, just
browse to the CD directory and locate the information.  There is no information
located in the interface that you can not access without it.
