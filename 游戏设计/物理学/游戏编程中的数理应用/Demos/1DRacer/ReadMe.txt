The 1D-Racer demonstrates the motion of an object with constant acceleration moving through space.  The formulas are clearly marked in the Game class' header (Game.h) by the large comment block.  The work space was created in Visual Studio 6.0, although the files can easily be added to any existing workspace without having to change the project settings, as long as the compiler is configured to know where DirectX include and library files are located.  The program's executable requires that DirectX 8.1 runtime or higher be installed on the machine, and to compile the code yourself, you must have the DirectX 8.1 SDK (Software Developer's Kit) or higher.  Both of these can be downloaded for free from Microsoft's website at www.Microsoft.com.
