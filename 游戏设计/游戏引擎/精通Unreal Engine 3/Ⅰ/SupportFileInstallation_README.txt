By copying the files to this location, you allow for the 
maps to be loaded in the editor without having to manually
load up the packages first. If you get a missing package error 
when loading up any of the support maps, please verify that
the files were copied to the appropriate path, or open the 
reported package manually in the Generic Browser and then re-launch
the map.
