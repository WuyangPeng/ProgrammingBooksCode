Due to the publishing timeline for AI Wisdom, the files on this CD to create
the Free Fuzzy Logic Library (FFLL) were submitted to the publisher in December 2001.

It is likely that FFLL has seen many enhancements since that time, we encourage you to
get the latest-and-greatest FFLL files from: http://ffll.sourceforge.net/

These files have been compiled and tested using MSVC 6.0 on:
	- Windows 98
	- Windows NT
	- Windows 2000
	- Windows Me
	- Windows XP
