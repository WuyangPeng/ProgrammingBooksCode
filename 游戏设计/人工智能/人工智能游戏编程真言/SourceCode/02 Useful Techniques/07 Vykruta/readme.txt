LOSGridDemo notes                                      

All article-related code is contained in TransformMat.h and TransformMat.cpp.  Clearly MFC was a poor choice even for such a trivial project.  I have taken measures to trim as much fat as possible, but I advise you to NOT look at the other files included within the project.  Sweet jesus, MFC is a cryptic mysterious beast like no other.  Simplicity, elegance and cleanliness will prevail in the future.  The system described in the article is currently in use by a commercial playstation2 project codenamed DRAKAN 2. It has proved to be a tremendous success.  
Let's get down to brass tacks. How much for the ape, you ask?  The ideas are freeware, the source code is not.
