Ray traced images

The images in the general RayTracedImages.zip download are all CMYK, as these 
were used for printing. The images in this chapter download are mainly RGB, which 
often improves the colors for on-screen viewing. I've re-rendered Figures 28.22 and 
28.52, and a few others at higher resolution.

Extra images

There are a few extra images with explanations.

Build functions

I've included the build functions for all the ray traced images except Figure 28.42. I 
haven't had time to update my path tracing code to re-render this figure.

Code

The code directory has the following classes:

ConcaveLens (Figure 28.11)
CutFace (Figure 28.52)
FishBowl (Figure 28.41)
GlassOfWater (Figure 28.38)

It also has some code for the FresnelTransmitter BTDF and the Dielectric class, 
mainly the chapter listings. You can implement these classes as an exercise.
