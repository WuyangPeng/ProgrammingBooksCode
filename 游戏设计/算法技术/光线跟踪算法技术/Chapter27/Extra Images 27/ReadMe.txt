These images are Figures 27.15(b), 24(a), 27.28, and 27.29 rendered using the
 Dielectric material from Chapter 28 with a yellow-green filter color. The color
 filtering makes it easier to see the areas of total internal reflection. I've also 
included a version of Figure 27.29 with eta = 0.75.

The version of Figure 27.19(c) is rendered with a light blue dielectric material, just 
because it looks better.
