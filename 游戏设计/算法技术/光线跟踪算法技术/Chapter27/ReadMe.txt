Ray traced images

The images in the general RayTracedImages.zip download are all CMYK, as these 
were used for printing. The images in this chapter download are mainly RGB, which 
often improves the colors for on-screen viewing.

Extra images

There are a few extra images with explanations.

Build functions

I've included as many of the build functions as I can at present. The missing build 
functions are as follows:

Figure 27.22 - The text "Ray Tracing from the Ground Up" was not imported in a 
ppm file, and I haven't had time to update the code.

Figure 27.25 - Giving you the build function would give you the answer to Question 
27.13.


Code

The code directory has the following classes:

BTDF base class
PerectTransmitter BTDF class

It also has the Transparent class code in Listings 27.3 and 27.4. You can implement 
the Transparent material as an exercise.
