<p align="center">About the <em>Game Programming Gems 2</em> CD-ROM</font></p>
</b>

<p>This CD contains source code and demos which demonstrate the techniques described in
the book.&nbsp; Every attempt has been made to ensure that the source code is bug-free and
will compile easily on multiple platforms.&nbsp; Please refer to the websites <a
href="http://www.gameprogramminggems.com">http://www.GameProgrammingGems.com</a> and <a
href="http://www.satori.org/gems2">http://www.satori.org/</a> for errata and updates.</p>

<p><strong>CONTENTS</strong></p>

<p><em>SourceCode: </em>The source code and demos contained on this CD are contained in a
hierarchy of subdirectories based on section name and Gem title/author.&nbsp; Source code
and listings from the book are included.&nbsp; At each author's discretion a complete demo
is sometimes included.&nbsp; Windows demos were compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
and are indicated by a .dsw file.&nbsp; Executables for each demo are included on the CD,
and you can recompile them using the .dsw file and/or Makefile.</p>

<p><em>ColorImages</em>: For your amusement we've placed TIFF files (RGB flavor) of the
book's color plates on the CD as well.&nbsp; Special thanks to the authors of these
fabulous images.</p>

<p><em>glSetup: </em>Included on this CD you will find the glSetup &quot;monolithic&quot;
v1.0.0.121 beta distribution, courtesy of Chris Hecker and GLSetup Incorporated (<a
href="http://www.glsetup.com/">http://www.glsetup.com/</a>).&nbsp; glSetup is a program
which automates the installation of Windows OpenGL drivers.&nbsp; You can use this program
to install the newest drivers for your 3D graphics card as of April 12, 2001 (the date of
this program's creation).&nbsp; You can also visit the glSetup website and download the
latest version for free.</p>

<p><em>GLUT:</em> In this directory you will also find the GLUT v3.8 beta distribution,
courtesy of Mark J. Kilgard.&nbsp; The files in the GLUT directory include the source
distribution, datafile distribution, Win32 library and header file, and the manual
pages.&nbsp; You can compile versions for your own system directly from these
distributions, or visit the official GLUT website at <a
href="http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/glut3.html">http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/glut3.html</a>.
&nbsp; For Windows-specific information, please bisit Nate Robins' website at <a
href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html">http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html</a>.</p>

<p><em>DirectX8</em>: If you're running on Windows, you're very likely using the DirectX
API.&nbsp; For your convenience this directory holds version 8.0a of the DirectX SDK.</p>

<p><strong><b>OTHER USEFUL PACKAGES</b></strong></p>

<p><em>The Mesa 3D Graphics Library:</em> Mesa is a 3D graphics library with an API which
is very similar to that of OpenGL.&nbsp; Actually, it's basically a drop-in replacement
for OpenGL.&nbsp; If for some reason you can't get your OpenGL drivers to work under
Windows or Linux, check out Mesa!&nbsp; Mesa is located at <a
href="http://www.mesa3d.org/">http://www.mesa3d.org/</a>.</p>

<p><em>WinZip:</em> WinZip is an archive utility for Windows.&nbsp; You can use it to
unpack the GLUT ZIP files on the CD.&nbsp; The evaluation version can be download for free
at <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">http://www.winzip.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>Paint Shop Pro:</em> Paint Shop Pro is a great program which you can use to edit
images, photos, Web graphics, etc.&nbsp; The evaluation version can be downloaded for free
at <a href="http://www.jasc.com/">http://www.jasc.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>SmartDraw: </em>SmartDraw is a diagram editor which allows you to create charts and
move many diagram formats between programs seamlessly.&nbsp; It is a life-saver if you
ever need a quick diagram for your slide presentation or want to get some line art copied
out into a bitmap.&nbsp; You can download the free trial program at <a
href="http://www.smartdraw.com/">http://www.smartdraw.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>StarOffice:</em> StarOffice is a free suite of tools very similar to Microsoft
Office.&nbsp; The suite is available for Solaris, Windows, Linux and OS/2 and
interoperates with Microsoft formats very well.&nbsp; You can get the tools from Sun
Microsystems via their website at <a href="http://www.sun.com/">http://www.sun.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>Acrobat Reader: </em>To read the PDF included with the GLUT 3.8 distribution you
will need a copy of the Adobe Acrobat Reader.&nbsp; It is a very handy way to distribute
typeset files over the net, and it's available for Windows, Mac, OS/2, Palm, and a variety
of Unix flavors.&nbsp; You can download Acrobat Reader via <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</a>.</p>

<p><strong><b>RELATED WEBSITES</b></strong></p>

<p>If you're reading this, you're probably either a professional game developer, want to
be a professional game developer, or you're interested in writing games just for fun.
&nbsp; There are many, many web resources for game developers.&nbsp; Here are a few of the
best that you should know about:</p>

<p><em>GDConf: </em>The Game Developers Conference, it is currently held every year in San
Jose, California (USA).&nbsp; Their website is at <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">http://www.gdconf.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>GDMag:</em> Game Developer Magazine, arguably the game development industry's best
magazine for developers.&nbsp; It is published monthly, and you can may be able to get it
for free in the U.S. if you're a professional developer.&nbsp; Source code to accompany
the magazine articles is contained on their website, at <a href="http://www.gdmag.com/">http://www.gdmag.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>Gamasutra:</em> Gamasutra is the web equivalent of GDMag.&nbsp; It publishes some
of the articles from GDMag as well as articles written specifically for the website.
&nbsp; Gamasutra also includes industry news, community chat areas, and a variety of other
useful services.&nbsp; Find Gamasutra at <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/">http://www.gamasutra.com/</a>.</p>

<p><em>International Game Developers Association:</em> The IGDA is a non-profit
association dedicated to linking game developers together around the globe, and
encouraging the sharing of information among them.&nbsp; Their website is <a
href="http://www.igda.org/">http://www.igda.org/</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other great websites, print publications, and conferences popping up
around the world to support our industry.&nbsp; Be sure to support your local
organizations!</p>

<p><b><strong>EDITOR'S NOTES</strong></b></p>

<p>The intent of having this code available on CD is multifold.&nbsp; A lot of the source
code included here can be used in your games right now!&nbsp; Some of the other source
code can be browsed to learn particular techniques, or cannibalized and tweaked for use in
utilities and libraries.&nbsp; Whatever you use it for, I hope you enjoy it and learn from
it.</p>

<p>The source code and demos worked properly as of June 2001, and I'm going to put a bit
of information here about the test machine to give you a sense of 1) a working
configuration, and 2) what technology was like in the year 2001!</p>

<p>All code was tested on komu.satori.org, a PentiumII 450MHz (256MB) machine with an
NVIDIA 32MB GeForce2 GTS (25 Mverts/second) graphics card.&nbsp; On the Windows side it
runs WinME with DirectX 8.0a, GLUT 3.8 and Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.&nbsp; On the Linux
side it is mostly the Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 &quot;potato&quot; release, with kernel version
2.2.15, XFree86 4.0, the NVIDIA Beta OpenGL driver, GLUT 3.7, Mesa 3.2, GCC 2.95.2, and
glibc 2.1.2.&nbsp; In practice, both of these configurations were very stable for OpenGL
development and 3D performance was excellent.</p>

<p>During this project, the <em>SmartDraw</em> and <em>Paint Shop Pro</em> utilities were
invaluable to me, so I have included links to their websites above.&nbsp; Emacs and VI
were also used pretty heavily for code editing, but you probably know where to find those
if you like them!&nbsp; The game-related websites listed are very useful and many of the
Gem authors have been published in them or have presented at the conference.&nbsp; Check
them out!</p>
