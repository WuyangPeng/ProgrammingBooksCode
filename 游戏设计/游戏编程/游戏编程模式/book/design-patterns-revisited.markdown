^title Design Patterns Revisited

*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* is nearly
twenty years old by my watch. Unless you're looking over my shoulder, there's a
good chance *Design Patterns* will be old enough to drink by the time you read
this. For an industry as quickly moving as software, that's practically ancient.
The enduring popularity of the book says something about how timeless design
is compared to many frameworks and methodologies.

While I think *Design Patterns* is still relevant, we've learned a lot in the
past couple of decades. In this section, we'll walk through a handful of the
original patterns the Gang of Four documented. For each pattern, I hope to have
something useful or interesting to say.

I think some patterns are overused (<a href="singleton.html">Singleton</a>),
while others are underappreciated (<a href="command.html">Command</a>). A couple
are in here because I want to explore their relevance specifically to games (<a
href="flyweight.html">Flyweight</a> and <a href="observer.html">Observer</a>).
Finally, sometimes I just think it's fun to see how patterns are enmeshed in
the larger field of programming (<a href="prototype.html">Prototype</a> and <a
href="state.html">State</a>).

## The Patterns

  * [Command](command.html)
  * [Flyweight](flyweight.html)
  * [Observer](observer.html)
  * [Prototype](prototype.html)
  * [Singleton](singleton.html)
  * [State](state.html)
