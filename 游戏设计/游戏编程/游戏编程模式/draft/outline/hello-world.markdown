^title Hello World

Here's a general summary of the problem or problems that this pattern
can solve. It's a fairly short introductory paragraph to the pattern.
Note that it lacks a header. It ends with a single *emphasized
summary of the pattern*.

## The Pattern
This is the main expository section of the pattern. It explains what
the pattern is in terms of an example application. Although it
references an example, it does not use code to explain the pattern.
This is still the pattern in fairly general terms.

> This is a sidebar section. These can be used anywhere in the book
> to provide additional, but not necessary, information about the
> following passage.
>
> It has two paragraphs.

This section will likely be a page or two long, and will often contain
diagrams or other helpful illustrations.

## Implementation
This longer section walks through the important skeleton of an
implementation of the example pattern described in the previous
section. It will not necessarily show *all* of the code required to
implement the pattern, just enough to get the idea across.

Because of the step-by-step nature of this section, and the frequent
code samples, this will likely be the longer part of the chapter.

Just for format testing, here's an ordered list:

1.  This is the first item. It has a pretty long body of text so that
    we can ensure that text wrapping is working correctly.
    
    *   And this is a nested list. It has a pretty long body of text so
        that we can ensure that text wrapping is working correctly.

        1.  Three levels of nesting should be plenty. Make it nice and
            long so we can ensure word wrap wraps at the right place.
            
    *   Second nested item.
    
2.  This is the second item.

3.  This is the third item.

Here is one code sample:

^code 1

Just to test code inclusion and ensure it's working right, here's
another:

^code 2

## Applications
This short section describes common uses of the pattern. It may be
omitted if not useful.

## Related Patterns
Patterns are often used in tandem or in place of other patterns. This
section, if relevant, describes other patterns that often touch on
this one.

**How are refinements handled? Do they get all of the sections the
full pattern gets?**
