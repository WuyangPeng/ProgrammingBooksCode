Two programs are included in this directory for your enjoyment.

The first program is included in two versions, the second being a Macintosh
version which includes dialog boxes and help windows --- it was the SPHIGS
tutorial shown at SIGGRAPH '90.

				   SPHDEMO*.c

AUTHOR: D. Sklar

This program is an interactive model-viewing system.  A model of a neighborhood
of houses is created and the camera is initialized.  You can change the
camera's position, orientation, and parameters by using keystrokes.  The user
interface is poor, but it is a satisfactory method for getting acquainted with
the SPHIGS camera model.

Two images of the model are visible on the screen.  In the larger viewport is a
solid, shaded image that is the (currently) highest-quality image SPHIGS can
produce.  In the smaller viewports are wireframe-raw images produced using
ORTHOGRAPHIC projection; they also show the view volume and the location of the
PRP and VRP.

The numeric keys allow you to choose which part of the camera you wish to
modify.  Each time you hit one of these keys, a prompt is sent to the console
(e.g., xterm, hpterm) to remind you which camera part you are 
currently manipulating.

	1	change the VRP along the UVN axes 
		   (to move the camera relative to current orientation)
	2	change the VRP along the XYZ axes
		   (to move the camera relative to World Coordinate system)
	3	change the VPN (to rotate the camera)
	4	change the PRP (to change the focal length)
	5	change the front clipping-plane distance
	6	change the back clipping-plane distance

	0 	restore the camera to default location, orientation, etc.

You manipulate the "camera part" that you have selected, on three axes:
	X (or U)
	Y (or V)
	Z (or N)

To manipulate on the X axis, you use "s" for left and "d" for right.
	"s" subtracts			"d" adds

To manipulate on the Y axis, you use "e" for up and "x" for down.
	"x" subtracts 			"e" adds 

To manipulate on the Z axis, you use "+" to move away from the model (towards
positive infinity) and "-" to move into the model.  (The model's vertices all
have negative Z coords.)
	"-" subtracts 			"=" adds 

Each time you hit one of the above six keys, the camera is moved by STEPSIZE
units or rotated by STEPSIZE degrees.  The default step size is 30
units/degrees, but you can manipulate the step size using the "<" (to decrease
it by 5) and ">" (to increase it by 5) keys.  The current step size is
echoed to the console whenever it is changed.

You can restore the camera's attributes to their default values (as they are
when the program starts up) by hitting '0'.  This is a great way to recover if
you've gotten "lost".

You can also edit the camera settings with the mouse.  Currently, dragging in
the perspective view has the following effect, depending on which mouse button
is held down:

	Left Button	- Translates camera in U-V film plane
	Middle Button 	- Translates camera in and out along N axis
	Right Button 	- Rotates camera using a virtual trackball

The mouse is touchy, and may jump if you move too quickly.  This is because of
the time lag between processing events and re-rendering.

You can add a chimney to each house by entering a capital "C", and remove it by
entering a lowercase "c".

You can eliminate the wireframe orthographic views (and blow up the nicely
renderered view to full window size) by hitting lowercase 'a', and restore all
the views by hitting capital 'A'.

You can toggle the larger view between different rendering modes as follows:
	"f"			to set rendering to lit-flat shading
	"F"			to set rendering to flat shading
	"w"			to set rendering to quality wireframe
	"W"			to set rendering to raw wireframe

You can turn double-buffering on and off by pressing "b" or "B", respectively.

You can switch between orthographic and perspective viewing by pressing "}"
and "{", respectively.

You can activate a floor grid by typing "G".

You can switch between the RENDER_BSP and RENDER_PAINTERS rendering algorithms
by pressing "P" and "p", respectively.

Input pick correlation is demonstrated by simply clicking the mouse button
anywhere within the main (perspective) viewport.  If you click on any part of a
house, you will see a message reporting which house you picked.

				 robot_anim.c

AUTHOR: Atul Butte

To run it, type:  "robot_anim < robot_anim.data"

A brief animation of a robot.  Uses SPHIGS' built-in double-buffering mode.

When executing, be sure to redirect stdin so the program
can read from the data file: "robot_anim.data"

The code for this program is a good example of the use of structure-network
editing for animation purposes.
