<h1>
STUDY 20 OBVIOUS FINAL DIFFERENCES</h1>

<h2>
COLOUR</h2>
It is instructive to compare, say, <a href="file:///F|/learning/STUDY20/SCANLN.TIF">scanln</a>
(scan line rendered based on Phong illumination model), <a href="file:///F|/learning/STUDY20/RAYTR.TIF">raytr</a>
(Whitted ray traced), <a href="file:///F|/learning/STUDY20/RADIOS.TIF">radios</a>
(hybrid radiosity-raytraced) and <a href="file:///F|/learning/STUDY19/scenehi2.tif">radnce
</a>(RADIANCE).
The scene database used in all cases is identical and the rendering was
evaluated at three (RGB) spectral points. Note that the colours in the
Phong and the ray traced image are the same as we would expect; but that
there are colour shifts in the radiosity and the RADIANCE images. There
are a number of reasons for this.
<ol>
<li>
In the radiosity image we are simulating diffuse-diffuse interaction which
'carries' colour from surface to surface - the characteristic colour bleeding
effect (see <a href="file:///F|/learning/STUDY15/STUDY15.HTM">STUDY 15</a>).
The extent to which this happens depends upon spatial relationship of the
patches, their diffuse reflectivity and the original colours of the patches
which are interacting. It is easy to get 'too much' colour bleeding by
having high reflectivities (see, for example, <a href="file:///F|/learning/STUDY15/RDCB2.TIF">rdcb2</a>)
and this is yet another aspect of a radiosity image that requires 'user
tuning'. In Phong and ray tracing the diffuse reflectivity coefficients
exclusively determine the colour of diffuse surfaces.</li>

<li>
In the RADIANCE image extra paths are accounted for (LS*DE) paths which
will also effect the colour.</li>

<li>
Different rendering methods have different facilities which can effect
the final colour. For example, with RADIANCE, the solution produced is
such that each pixel has three values associated with it which give the
amount of light energy entering the camera from that particular direction
at each of the Red, Green and Blue wavelengths. A final process is then
carried out which converts this "power" image into a standard image based
on an "exposure" parameter (equivalent to the exposure on a camera). This
process is ignored in radiosity, phong and raytraced images.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
IMAGE DEFINITION</h2>
Another notable difference is that the RADIANCE image looks fuzzy. This
is probably a combination of factor 3) above and the fact that Radiance
is combining information from non-uniform sampling of the scene (due to
the anti-aliasing method used).
<h2>
LIGHT LEVELS</h2>
The approach to the setting of light levels when creating a scene varies
based on the method used. This ranges from arbitrary values for the ambient,
point light, and spot lights generaly used in scanline/raytraced scenes,
to physical units (relating to light power output) used in RADIANCE. Attempting
to choose values which will give similar results for each method is usually
a matter of trial and error.&nbsp;
