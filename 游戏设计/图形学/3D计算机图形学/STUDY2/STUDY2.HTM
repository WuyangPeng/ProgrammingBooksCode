BASIC RENDERING OPTIONS FOR POLYGON MESH OBJECTS</h2>

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=10 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="100"><a href="AMBPNG.TIF"><img SRC="AMBPNG.GIF" ALT="ambpng.gif" height=75 width=100></a></td>

<td>Phong shaded scene - ambient term only. In any Phong shaded scene the
ambient lighting intensity, which compensates for the lack of any global
illumination calculations, is set to a fairly low level. It has to illuminate
areas of the scene that cannot 'see' a light source and at the same time
not dominate the shaded parts of the scene.</td>

<td><a href="ADPNG.TIF"><img SRC="ADPNG.GIF" ALT="adpng.gif" height=75 width=100></a></td>

<td>Phong shaded - ambient and diffuse terms.
<br>The illumination of wall from wall lights appears to be in the wrong
place. This is due to the screen space interpolation which operates with
equal distances (pixels) and ignores the fact that a perspective transformation
has taken place mapping equal distances along the wall into varying distances.
This is one of the classic problems with Phong shading.&nbsp;
<p>Another problem, often ignored, is what to do with visible light sources.
Treating them as a shaded object doesn't quite work. In this case the point
light source is inside the surrounding sphere and cannot by definition
illuminate it. We can only get illumination from the wall light and turn
up the ambient component for the light object The wall light are spotlights
with the cone angle coinciding with the geometry of the light source.</td>

<td>Phong shaded - <a href="KDKSXX.HTM">array of images</a> showing a Phong
shaded teapot with different Ks and Kd ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 in 0.2 steps
(6x6=36 images). The 'traditional' way of illustrating the shading equation
parameters. (Ka=0.7, exponent = 10.0 in all images)</td>

<td WIDTH="100"><a href="KSXPXX.HTM"><img SRC="KSXPFL.GIF" height=75 width=100></a></td>

<td>Phong shaded - <a href="KSXPXX.HTM">5x5 array of images</a> showing
different Ks and exponent values (with Ka=0.7, Kd=1.0). Ks is increasing
across and exponent is increasing down. Values used are Ks: 0.0, 0.25,
0.5, 0.75, 1.0. exponent: 10.0, 30.0, 90.0, 270.0, 810.0
<br>Note Phong illumination model attempts to model increasing "shininess"
by simply making size of specular highlight smaller.&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="CMPFLT.TIF"><img SRC="CMPFLT.GIF" ALT="cmpflt.gif" height=75 width=100></a></td>

<td>Full scene flat shaded. flat shading shows the polygonal nature of
the surfaces due to discontinuities in intensity. Shading changes across
large polygons do not appear (e.g. illumination of the wall lights on the
wall).</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="CMPGR.TIF"><img SRC="CMPGR.GIF" ALT="cmpgr.gif" height=75 width=100></a></td>

<td><a NAME="cmpgr"></a>cmpgr - Full scene Gouraud shaded. The illumination
on the walls due to the spot lights does not appear. Note artefact on back
wall (see image cpgrs and cpgrsw below). The polygon edges are still slightly
visible due to discontinuities in intensity gradient - the characteristic
Mach banding effect. This effect persists in radiosity imagery where a
form of Gouraud interpolation is used to interpolate a constant radiosity
(per patch) solution. There is a parallel between the flat/Gouraud image
and basic radiosity solution/final solution (see later images).</td>

<td>ditto -Phong shaded Note that if polygon mesh resolution of objects
is fairly high then the difference between Gouraud and Phong can be fairly
subtle - as the size of the polygons approaches single pixels in screen
space then the shading will approach Phong shading.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="CMPFLZ.TIF"><img SRC="CMPFLZ.GIF" ALT="cmpflz.gif" height=75 width=100></a></td>

<br>Phong highlight is lost since none of the mesh vertices are close to
it.</td>

<td>difference image between cmpgr (Gouraud scene) and adspng (Phong scene).
Note that most differences appear on the large walls. There is little difference
around the Phong highlights since mesh resolutions are high. (Both images
were converted to grey scale, then the difference image was generated and
histogram stretched.</td>

mesh.</td>

<td>When Gouraud shading large polygons, artefacts can appear see back
wall in cmpgr. This is due to the scan line conversion algorithm switching
between different edges as it scans down the polygon. Here we remove this
by splitting the polygon into triangles.</td>
