<H2>Please Note:</H2>
This study contains a very large number of images. Thumbnail inline images are in GIF format, mostly linking to larger TIFF files. Most browsers will require an extra helper application to view TIFF files. TIFF viewers for the Mac, Windows and Unix platforms can be downloaded from: <A HREF="http://modarch.gsfc.nasa.gov/VIEWERS/TIFF/">http://modarch.gsfc.nasa.gov/VIEWERS/TIFF/</A><BR>
 Animations are in AVI format.
