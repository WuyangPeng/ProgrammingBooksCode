<H1>STUDY 6  SIMPLE LIGHT SOURCE OPTIONS</H1>

The following series demonstrates the common variations that can be made with point light sources and a local refection model such as Phong. Spotlights are basically point sources with the addition of a cone of influence. Objects can only interact with the light if they are within the
cone.

</td><td>
Distant light source (parallel rays) eye light source (always positioned coincidentally with the
camera)- there never any shadows from this.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="LIPNT.TIF"><IMG SRC="LIPNT.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="lipnt"></A>		
</td><td>
Point light source positioned quite close to vase object - direction from point to centre of vase is
same as "distant" light source direction. Note that the shadows are different to those created
with distant light source - the incoming light rays are no longer parallel.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="LIEYE.TIF"><IMG SRC="LIEYE.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="lieye"></A>
</td><td>
Creates a point light source coincident with the eye; thus no shadows are produced.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="LISPT1.TIF"><IMG SRC="LISPT1.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="lispt1"></A>	
</td><td>
Spot light in same position as point light - cone angle is 30 degrees. Note that there are apparently two shadows. The vase shadow is created normally. The spotlight shadow is not explicitly a shadow - just an area outside the cone of influence.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="LISPT2.TIF"><IMG SRC="LISPT2.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="lispt2"></A>
</td><td>
Spotlight cones can easily be modulated by defining a drop of zone which softens the edges of the 'shadow'. This image has a 'drop of' zone of 5 degrees

<A HREF="LISPT3.TIF"><IMG SRC="LISPT3.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="lispt3"></A>	
</td><td>
same as above but a  "beam distribution" parameter has been turned up. This makes the light within the main part of the beam drop off  away from the main axis.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="FAOFF1.TIF"><IMG SRC="FAOFF1.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="faoff1"></A>	
</td><td>
the next  three images illustrate attenuated light sources - here the point light source is normal i.e. there is no drop off of the light as we move away from the light source.	
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="FAOFF2.TIF"><IMG SRC="FAOFF2.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="faoff2"></A>	
</td><td>
here we have 1/d drop off.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="FAOFF3.TIF"><IMG SRC="FAOFF3.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="faoff3"></A>	
</td><td>
here we have 1/d2 drop off.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<A HREF="FGDC.TIF"><IMG SRC="FGDC.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="fgdc"></A>	
</td><td>
depth cueing - intensity of "white fog" increases linearly with depth. Starting at the nearest object
in the scene and ending at the furthest. A much loved 'feature' of dubious worth.
