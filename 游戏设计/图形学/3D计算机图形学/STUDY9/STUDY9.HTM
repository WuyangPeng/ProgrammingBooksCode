STUDIES 9-13 RAY TRACING</h1>

<h2>
STUDY 9 BASIC RAY TRACING</h2>
<a href="RTFULL.TIF"><img SRC="RTFULL.GIF" ALT="rtfull" height=75 width=100></a>
<p>Basic/Whitted/Recursive/eye/Forward ray tracing of the standard scene.
The differences between this and the Phong version are obvious. A few points
are worth noting. The shadows are hard-edged which is the normal option
in ray tracing. (At each intersection point a light ray is shot to the
point source.) These look wrong compared to the options that can easily
be implemented in shadow mapping (see <a href="../STUDY5/SHMAP.TIF">shmap</a>).
Another 'effect' that looks wrong is the blue glass vase by the door. Here
the sharp refraction of the shadow makes the vase look as if it possesses
a black band rather than refracting detail behind it.
<p>There are around 10,000 polygons in this scene and using a normal/brute
force intersection testing approach would make the scene 'unrenderable'.
In this case a spatial partitioning (octree) approach was used.
<p>An important comparison between ray tracing for specular interaction
and environment mapping is that in ray tracing it is easy to assign specular
reflectivity coefficients to as many objects in the scene as necessary.
With environment mapping a separate map has to be created for each shiny
object.
<h3>
THE WHITTED IMAGE - BASIC RECURSIVE RAY TRACING</h3>
<a href="RAYDEMO.EXE">Raydemo</a> (note that this is an interactive program
for PC's with Windows 95. If you do not have this facility then the image
<a href="WHIT_IL.TGA">whit_il</a> can be used. Run Raydemo by opening the
Study 9 folder and clicking on the icon.).
<p>The image in the ray tracing demonstration is based on the original
image generated by Turner Whitted in 1981
<p>We consider the way in which the ray tracing model works in the context
of the 7 pixels shown highlighted. The scene itself consists of a thin
walled or hollow sphere, that is almost perfectly transparent, together
with a partially transparent white sphere, both of which are floating above
the ubiquitous red and yellow chequerboard. Everywhere else in object space
is a blue background. The object properties are summarised in the following
table. Note that this model allows us to set ks to a different value from
krg - the source of a contradiction in the model - reflected rays are treated
differently depending on which component (local or global) is being considered.

<p>The rays associated with the pixels shown are:
<br>Ray 1
<p>This ray is along a direction where a specular highlight is seen on
the highly transparent sphere.Because the ray is near the mirror direction
of L, the contribution from the specular component in Ilocal(P) is high
and the contributions from krgI(Pr) is low . For this object kd the local
diffuse coefficient is low (it is multiplied by 1 - transparency value)
and ks is high with respect to krg. However note that the local contribution
only dominates over a very small area of the surface of the object. Also
note that, as we have already mentioned the highlight should not be spread.
But if we left it as occupying a single pixel it would not be visible.
<br>Ray 2
<p>Almost the same as Ray 1 except that the specular highlight appears
on the inside wall of the hollow sphere. This particular ray demonstrates
another accepted error in ray tracing. Effectively the ray from the light
travels through the sphere without refracting (that is we simply compare
L with the local value of N and ignore the fact that we are now inside
a sphere). This means that the specular highlight is in the wrong position
but we simply accept this because we have no intuitive expectation of the
correct position anyway. We simply accept it to be correct.
<br>Ray 3
<p>Ray 3 also hits the thin walled sphere. The local contribution at all
hits with the hollow sphere are zero and the predominant contribution is
the chequerboard. This is subject to slight distortion due to the refractive
effect of the sphere walls. The red (or yellow) colour comes from the high
kd in Ilocal(P) where P is a point on the chequerboard. krg and ktg are
zero for this surface. Note, however, that we have a mix of 2 chequerboards.
One is as described and the other is the superimposed reflection on the
outside surface of the sphere.
<br>Ray 4
<p>Again this hits the thin walled sphere, but this time in a direction
where the distance travelled through the glass is significant (that is
it only travels through the glass it does not hit the air inside) causing
a high refractive effect and making the ray terminate in the blue background.
<br>Ray 5
<p>This ray hits the opaque sphere and returns a significant contribution
from the local component due to a white kd (local). At the first hit the
global reflected ray hits the chequerboard. Thus there is a mixture of:
<br>white (from the spheres diffuse component)
<br>red/yellow (reflected from the chequerboard).
<br>Ray 6
<p>This ray hits the chequerboard initially and the colour comes completely
from the local component for that surface. However, the point is in shadow
and this is discovered by the intersection of the ray L and the opaque
sphere.
<br>Ray 7
<p>The situation with this ray is exactly the same as for ray 5 except
that it is the thin walled sphere that intersects L . Thus the shadow area
intensity is not reduced by as much as the previous case. Again we do not
consider the recursive effect that L would in fact experience and so the
shadow is in effect in the wrong place.
