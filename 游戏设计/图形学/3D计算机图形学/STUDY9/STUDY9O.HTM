<H2>STUDY 9 BASIC RAY TRACING</H2>

<A HREF="RTFULL.TIF"><IMG SRC="RTFULL.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="rtfull"></A>
<P>Basic/Whitted/Recursive/eye/Forward ray tracing of the standard scene. The differences between this and the Phong version are obvious. A few points are worth noting. The shadows are hard-edged which is the normal option in ray tracing. (At each intersection point a light ray is shot to the point source.) These look wrong compared to the options that can easily be implemented in shadow mapping (see  <A HREF="../STUDY5/SHMAP.TIF">shmap</A>). Another 'effect' that looks wrong is the blue glass vase by the door. Here the sharp refraction of the shadow makes the vase look as if it possesses a black band rather than refracting detail behind it.</P>

<P>There are around 10,000 polygons in this scene and using a normal/brute force intersection testing approach would make the scene 'unrenderable'. In this case a spatial partitioning (octree) approach was used.</P>

<P>An important comparison between ray tracing for specular interaction and environment mapping is that in ray tracing it is easy to assign specular reflectivity coefficients to as many objects in the
scene as necessary. With environment mapping a separate map has to be created for each shiny object.</P>


<H3>THE WHITTED IMAGE - BASIC RECURSIVE RAY TRACING</H3>

<A HREF="RAYDEMO.EXE">Raydemo</A>  (note that this is an interactive program for PC's with Windows 95.  If you do not have this facility then the image <A HREF="WHIT_IL.TGA">whit_il</A> can be used).

<P>The image in the ray tracing demonstration is based on the  original image generated by Turner Whitted in 1981</P>

<P>We consider the way in which the ray tracing model works in the context of the 7 pixels shown highlighted. The scene itself consists of a thin walled or hollow sphere, that is almost perfectly transparent, together with a partially transparent white sphere, both of which are floating above
the ubiquitous red and yellow chequerboard. Everywhere else in object space is a blue background. The object properties are summarised in the following table. Note that this model allows us to set ks to a different value from krg - the source of a contradiction in the model - reflected rays are treated differently depending on which component (local or global) is being
considered.</P>

<P>The rays associated with the pixels shown are:</P>


Ray 1

<P>This ray is along a direction where a specular highlight is seen on the highly transparent sphere.Because the ray is near the mirror direction of L, the contribution from the specular component in Ilocal(P) is high and the contributions from krgI(Pr) is low . For this object kd the local diffuse coefficient is low (it is multiplied by 1 - transparency value) and ks is high with respect to krg. However  note that the local contribution only dominates over a very small area of the surface of the object. Also note that, as we have already mentioned the highlight should not be spread. But if we left it as occupying a single  pixel it would not be visible.</P>

Ray 2

<P>Almost the same as Ray 1 except that the specular highlight appears on the  inside wall of the hollow sphere. This particular ray demonstrates another accepted error in ray tracing. Effectively the ray from the light travels through the sphere without refracting (that is we simply compare L
with the local value of N and ignore the fact that we are now inside a sphere). This means  that the specular highlight is in the wrong position but we simply accept this because we have no intuitive expectation of the correct position anyway. We simply accept it to be correct.</P>

Ray 3

<P>Ray 3 also hits the thin walled sphere. The local contribution at all hits with the hollow sphere are zero and the predominant contribution is the chequerboard. This is subject to slight distortion due to the refractive effect of the sphere walls. The red (or yellow) colour comes from the high kd in Ilocal(P) where P is a point on the chequerboard. krg and ktg are zero for this surface. Note, however, that we have a mix of 2 chequerboards. One is as described and the other is the superimposed reflection on the outside surface of the sphere.</P>

Ray 4

<P>Again this hits the thin walled sphere, but this time in a direction where the distance travelled through the glass is significant (that is it only travels through the glass it does not hit the air inside) causing a high refractive effect and making the ray terminate in the blue background.</P>

Ray 5

<P>This ray hits the opaque sphere and returns a significant contribution from the local component due to a white kd (local). At the first hit the global reflected ray  hits  the chequerboard. Thus there is a mixture of:<BR>
white (from the spheres diffuse component)<BR>
red/yellow  (reflected from the chequerboard).</P>

Ray 6

<P>This ray hits the chequerboard initially  and the colour comes completely from the local component for that surface. However, the point is in shadow and this is discovered by the intersection of the ray L and the opaque sphere.</P>

Ray  7

<P>The situation with this ray is exactly the same as for ray 5 except that it is the thin walled sphere that intersects L . Thus the shadow area intensity is not reduced by as much as the previous case.  Again we do not consider the recursive effect that L would in fact experience and so the
shadow is  in effect in the wrong place.</P>
