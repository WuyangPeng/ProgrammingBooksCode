<H2>STUDY 15  COLOUR BLEEDING</H2>

<P>Oft described in explanations of radiosity is the effect of colour bleeding. Because radiosity implements 'diffuse-diffuse' interaction, colour is 'carried' from surface to surface. The  apparentness of this effect in real life is debatable. In other words we may not perceive much colour bleeding - which could be measured instrumentally - because of the perceptual predominance of colour constancy. Certainly colour bleeding is fixed in photographs as the next image demonstrates.</P>

Radiosity images show colour bleeding from a coloured light source onto the walls and the colour bleeding that results from window light reflecting from a coloured object. These have been take from near convergence and the effect, although correct as far as the algorithm is concerned, somehow looks wrong.  This may be due in part to the different way in which our colour constancy works in a real environment compared with a viewing a photograph. The reflectivity of the cylinder was set at 0.85. It may also be a consequence of the fact that a solution is only computed at three wavelengths.
