STUDIES 9-13 RAY TRACING</h1>

<h2>
STUDY 11 WHY RAY TRACING DOES NOT WORK EXCEPT FOR SCENES THAT IT WORKS
FOR</h2>
Not quite as tortuous as it sounds basic ray tracing only works well visually
for perfect mirror like objects. Ray tracing combines a local refection
model contribution with a global reflection and transmission component.
The rationale here is that this approach can handle objects that are not
perfectly reflecting or refracting. A ray traced image can be thus be viewed
as a combination of a local component and a component from a perfect refractor
or reflector. This immediately raises the contradiction that a specular
highlight is a spread reflection of the (necessarily) point light source
but reflections of other objects in the same surface are perfect (not spread).
Generally there is much confusion in the way in which local and global
components are used as the next series of images attempts to demonstrate.

<br>This is a montage of the popular options available in 'na&iuml;ve'
ray tracing. The top left hand image is a pure local reflection model or
Phong component which is kept constant throughout the array of images.
As we go along the top row the global refection proportion increases to
100% and the Phong spread highlight eventually gives way to the actual
image of the light source. The reason for keeping the Phong component constant
rather than diminishing it as the global component takes over is that its
contribution boosts the light level in the reflected image of the light
source. For example consider the second image in the top row.
<p>Going down the first column, the transparency is increased towards 100%.
Keeping the Phong component constant here now results in a contradiction
in the bottom image which is that we have a refection of the light source
and nothing else. However, in practice objects can never be perfectly refracting
and we often see glass objects where we can only perceive the refection
of the light source. In this image are also apparent geometric deficiencies
in the refracted image. This is due to the polygonal representation of
the object and the way in which surface normals are derived. Ray tracing
demands a surface normal at every hit point. This can never be the correct
surface normal because the polygon mesh is already an approximation. Also
apparent are bad aliasing artefacts along the silhouette edge of the object.
Such defects are not so apparent in the perfect reflection image. In the
reflection image the refracted objects are much closer to the glass teapot.
