<H2>AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR MODELLING REFLECTIONS (FLAT SURFACES)</H2>

The next four images illustrate an alternative method of modelling reflections in flat mirror surfaces (without resorting to ray tracing). The method consists of rendering the scene from a virtual camera position on the opposite side of the mirrored surface and then using part of this images for the reflection. The method is described in detail
below.<BR>

<H3 align="center">Figure 1. Alternative reflection method.</H3>

<P>The first stage in the process involves producing a mask which defines those pixels in the required image which are part of the reflection in the planar mirrored surface. In this case, this was generated by setting the ambient, diffuse and specular parameters to zero for all the objects in the scene except the mirror, and then rendering the scene using Phong shading. This creates the mask as seen in  <A HREF="ENVMSK.TIF">envmsk</A> (note teapot silhouette).</P>

<P>The next stage involves rendering the scene using a new set of "virtual" camera "from" and "to" positions (the "from" and "to" parameters are simply one method of defining the position and orientation of the camera). The position of these virtual points is found by reflecting the real camera "from" and "to" positions in the plane which contains the mirrored surface, as seen in figure 1. This stage generates an image, part of which is the reflection which we require (see <A HREF="ENVMIM.TIF">envmim</A> ). 
The mask (<A HREF="ENVMSK.TIF">envmsk</A>) and the reflection image (<A HREF="ENVMIM.TIF">envmim</A>) are then flipped (left to right) and the mask is used to isolate the required part of this image (see <A HREF="ENVRFL.TIF">envrfl</A>).</P>

<A HREF="ENVMSK.TIF"><IMG SRC="ENVMSK.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="envmsk"></A>

</td><td>
<A HREF="ENVRFL.TIF"><IMG SRC="ENVRFL.GIF" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=75 ALT="envrfl"></A>

</tr></table>

<P>An image of the scene from the real camera position is then rendered, and the mask is used to make the mirror area black.</P>

<P>Finally, the above image is added to <A HREF="ENVRFL.TIF">envrfl</A> to create the final image envfin.</P>

<H3>Note :</H3>
<OL>
<LI>The mirror reflections are geometrically correct.
<LI>Only a limited amount of inter-reflection can be produced. For example, we can see the reflection of the teapot in the mirror, but no deeper than that.
