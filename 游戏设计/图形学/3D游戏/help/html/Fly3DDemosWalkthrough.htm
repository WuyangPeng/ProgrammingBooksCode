<p>Follow this walkthrough for a full demo of all features included in the Fly3D engine.<br>
It will move you around all demo levels and give you clues on where to look and what to
do.</p>

<p>While in the game you can always use the following keys to switch some render states:</p>

<p>F3 - Mute sound<br>
F4 - Wireframe on/off<br>
F5 - Fog on/off<br>
F6 - Node only (draw single bsp node)<br>
F7 - PVS on/off<br>
F8 - Texture filtering on/off<br>
F9 - Multitexture of/off<br>
F10 - Map mode<br>
F11 - Mipmapping on/off<br>
F12 - Clear background on/off</p>

<h3>The MENU level:</h3>

<p>This is a level that implements a menu.<br>
It will be the main interface for changing levels and starting multiplayer servers.<br>
Pressing F1 while in any other level will load the menu.<br>
Use Up and Down keys to select the desired menu item and Enter to activate it.</p>

<p>Things to notice while in this level:</p>

<p>- The arches are ducted solids made with Bezier curves in the loft plug-in.<br>
- They have light maps and can change geometry detail while maintaining the lighting
detail.<br>
- Select options from the main menu group and change the detail settings by selecting the
LOW,MEDIUM and HIGH options.<br>
- Note that the surface subdivision is adaptative and areas with higher curvature gets
more polygons.<br>
- The menu item plug-in object execute console commads to implement its functionality.<br>
- Press ESC for opening/closing the console (all menu selections will be printed there).</p>

<h3>The CAR level:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is a level implementing a simple car race. Select the S.PLAY menu option and then
CAR for loading the level.<br>
Use Up arrow to move the car forward and Left and Right arrows to turn.<br>
There is another computer controled cars running around the track. Follow him the best you
can. To add more cars to the race, type the following comand on the console:</p>

<p class="code">activate car1</p>

<p>The scene is render as cartoon (bsp and dynamic objects) and for changing the number of
color levels used in the bsp and cars, type the following command on the console:</p>

<p class="code">set cartoonpicbsp gradient8.tga<br>
set cartoonpic gradient3.tga</p>

<p>Turn on antialiasing with the following console command:</p>

<p class="code">set antialias 1<br>
set cartoonwidth 1.5 </p>

<p>To add turn stencil shadows on (only for cards with stencil buffer support lilke the
TNT, TNT2 and GeForce256), execute the following console command line:</p>

<p class="code">set stencil 1</p>

<p>Some cards require the desktop windows mode to be at 32 bits/pixel in order to use
hardware stencil buffers. If it gets too slow when stencil shadows are on, try switching
to a 32 bit/pixel mode and re-run the level.</p>

<h3>The WALK level:</h3>

<p>This is a level implementing a walking first person shooter.<br>
Press F1 to return to the menu.<br>
Select S.PLAY and then WALK.</p>

<p>Things to notice while in this level:</p>

<p>- Use the mouse and the S and X keys to move around.<br>
- Use the left mouse button to shoot something in the scene.<br>
- Go to the yellow signs in the floor to jump around.<br>
- Press F9 to turn multitexture off and see the detail textures (will be slow on some
machines).<br>
- Use the right mouse button to zoom in and see the detail textures applied to all scene
geometry.<br>
- Press F9 again to turn multitexture on if framerate is not good because of detail
textures.<br>
- Press W to turn on/off the head lights (dynamic spot with light maps).<br>
- Several parts of the scene are Bezier surfaces (the arch, the top platform and some
corners of the scene).<br>
- Use the following console command for changing the surface detail:</p>

<p class="code">set curveerr 1 </p>

<p>and see the real round surfaces.</p>

<h3>The SHIP level:</h3>

<p>This is a level implementing a Descent like game (6 DOF ship inside a maze).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things to notice while in this level:</p>

<p>- Turn the head light by pressing the W key<br>
- Use the mouse and S,X,Q,E,A,D keys to move around<br>
- Use the right mouse button to kill the enemies<br>
- You can change the selected weapon using keys 1 to 6<br>
- On the first room you will find a turret. Destroy it!<br>
- Press the C key to turn the back camera on/off<br>
- Run to the rooms, destroy the enemies and take all the itens</p>

<h3>The BOX level:</h3>

<p>This is another level implementing a walking first person shooter.&nbsp;<br>
Load it with the following command line:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="code">map box/box.fly</p>

<p>Or use the F1 menu shortcut and select S.PLAY then BOX.<br>
Move around just like the previous walking demos (S,X,Q,E,arrows,mouse,SPACE)</p>

<p>Things to notice while in this level:</p>

<p>- On the center room, notice the dynamic shadow at the fan light.<br>
- On the same room, notice the cartoon like objects. Use the headlight (W key) to
illuminate them and notice that the scene lights dynamiclay illuminate them like cartoons.<br>
- Use the left mouse button to fire missiles (kill yourself by shooting near to yourself
and see the gibs and blood implemented with hitmarks).<br>
- The two other rooms include fog maps.<br>
- One is a red sphere fog. move inside it and see how fog maps makes a better fog than
vertex fog with no geometry tessellation.<br>
- The other fog is a box fog. Enter it and move around to see how the fog changes. Jump
out of the fog with the boxes.<br>
- This room also includes a ship/stone statue. They are subdivision surfaces. Change
detail with the following command line:</p>

<p class="code">set subdiv1.nsubdiv 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no detail on
stone (just a pyramid)<br>
set subdiv1.nsubdiv 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some detail<br>
set subdiv1.nsubdiv 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of detail<br>
set subdiv2.nsubdiv 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no detail on ship<br>
set subdiv2.nsubdiv 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some detail<br>
set subdiv2.nsubdiv 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of detail</p>

<p>- The dynamic objects are illuminated with hardware vertex lights. Notice the
ship/stone, red on one side and blue on the other.<br>
- Use the following command line to turn on/off the hardware lights:</p>

<p class="code">set hwlights
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn on<br>
set hwlights
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn off</p>

<p>- On a multiplayer game, the player model is also illuminated this way making a nice
looking effect as the player moves near game lights.<br>
- Fire a missile and notice the ship/stone also gets illuminated by the dynamic missile
light.</p>

<h3>The BOX level in multiplayer:</h3>

<p>Create a multiplayer server for the box level using the main menu:<br>
<br>
- Press F1 for loading the menu.<br>
- Select M.PLAY (multi player) and then the BOX level.<br>
- A server will start up. If all TCP/IP configurations are OK the server will show its
network address.<br>
- Join a game using CTRL-J (or select the join menu option)<br>
- Type the player name and click search.<br>
- If a game is found, select it and click the join button.<br>
- In another computer in the network, open the frontend and join the game as above. (if
you just have one computer you can run the server and two clients on the same machine)<br>
- Place one player behind the fan.<br>
- Use the other player to see the diffuse/specular player illumination (notice that the
fan also casts shadows over the player).<br>
- You can create other multiplayer games for the other demos just using the menu.</p>
