<h3>Tutorial 6</h3>
<p>Creating the level .PVS file</p>
<p>&middot; Introduction</p>
<p>The operations in this tutorial calculates the PVS using the non-deterministic 
  method described in the text. For a scene of high complexity, this program will 
  run for several hours. After completion you will have computed all node to node 
  visibility and enhanced the BSP tree with a connectivity matrix. The PVS will 
  be stored in a flie with extension .pvs.</p>
<p>&middot; Fly utilities operations</p>
<p>1) Execute the flyPVS.exe utility. In the flyEditor, use the Tools/View menu 
  option.</p>
<p> 2) Select the bsp file you created in tutorial 1 or 2.</p>
<p> 3) Select the sampling cube resolution. For this tutoriual a 64x64 resolution 
  is sufficient.</p>
<p> 4) Save PVSlog: this saves a .txt file with the same name as the BSP file 
  including information on the PVS construction. This facility records the statistics 
  of the pvs connectivity matrix, which can be examined for effectiveness.</p>
<p>5) Visibility Sample Factor: a useful parameter that sets the volume sampling 
  accuracy of the PVS calculation. The volume of each node is calculated and a 
  sampling density specified (cubic metres/sample).</p>
