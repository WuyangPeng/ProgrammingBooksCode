<h3>Tutorial 2</h3>
<p></p>
<p>More complex level modelling</p>
<p>&middot; Introduction</p>
<p>This tutorial details a simple methodology for building a closed environment 
  level. </p>
<p>At the end of the operations exemplified in this tutorial, we have constructed 
  the geometry of a level (stored as a .max file). </p>
<p>The basic building block is a box. The level is constructed by joining boxes 
  together, dragging vertices to convert the boxes into truncated rectangular 
  pyramids then deleting shared faces to create the final environment. An advantage 
  of this construction method is that correct topology is maintained for the environment. 
  This means that if a construction, such as that shown in last figure from this 
  tutorial is required, then the face normals will have the correct direction 
  (the direction of the surface normals must be consistent with the rule that 
  the entire environment must exhibit a single inside space and a single outside 
  space). This rule is more difficult to guarantee as more complex shapes are 
  used by an editor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&middot; 3D Studio Max operations</p>
<p>1) Draw 7 boxes as shown using the box creation tool</p>

<p> 2) Use the edit mesh modifier to move the vertices of boxes 2 and 6 as shown 
  so that they align with the vertices from boxes 1 and 7</p>

<p> 3) Attach all boxes to each other using the attach multiple tool to create 
  a single environment. All boxes now merge to form a single object</p>
<p> 4) Use the edit modifier again to remove the 6 pairs of shared faces (note 
  there are 2 triangles per face)</p>
<p> 5) Still using the edit mesh modifier, select all vertices and weld them with 
  the weld vertices tool deleting duplicated vertices (vertices that share the 
  same position in space).</p>

<p> 6) Still using the edit mesh modifier select all face and invert their normals 
  so that they point inwards.</p>

<p> 7) Apply material and texture mapping co-ordinates using the material editor 
  and UVW mapping tool.</p>
<p> 8) Create some light objects (you can use simple small box objects for example). 
  Place the lights in appropriate positions and apply a standard material with 
  self illumination value larger then 0.</p>
<p> 9) Associate real dimensions to your model by setting the desired values in 
  the Preferences menu on the general tab system unit scale. For example, for 
  a wall of 50 units length, you might set 0.2 unit = 1 meter, making the virtual 
  wall 10 meters long.</p>
