<h3>Tutorial 5</h3>
<p>Creating the level light map .LMP file</p>
<p>&middot; Introduction</p>
<p>The operations in this tutorial effect the construction of the light maps that 
  are used to illuminate the scene. At the end of this tutorial you will have 
  created the light maps (stored in a .lmp file). This caches the illumination 
  of all self illuminated faces and light objects in the scene light maps. </p>
<p> &middot; Fly utilities operations</p>
<p>1) Execute the flyLight.exe utility. In the flyEditor, use the Tools/Light 
  menu option.</p>
<p> 2) Select the .fly file you created in tutorial 3.</p>
<p> 3) Select the lighting options from:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Shadows: shadows are calculated for each light map pixel (increasing the 
    computation time for complex scenes).</li>
  <li> Connectivity: when off, this enables co-planar faces which are not connected 
    to share the same light map. This means that the total number of lightmaps 
    is kept as low as possible although it also implies that many light map pixels 
    will be redundant (mapping to space between such faces).</li>
  <li>Light Radius and Light Value: overwrites original setting from the materials 
    to facilitate editing at this stage. </li>
  <li>Pixel Size: the desired light map pixel size. Small values will make the 
    dynamic light slower.</li>
  <li>Ambient Light: amount of light to add to all light pixels (0 to 255).</li>
</ul>
<p>4) Press compute to start the lighting computations.</p>
